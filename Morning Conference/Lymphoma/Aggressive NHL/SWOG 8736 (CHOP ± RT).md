# Study
## 401 Pts
- Stage I
	- more favorable than [[ECOG 1484 (CHOP ± RT)]]
- bulky or non-bulky (66%),
- DLBCL (75%). 
- MFU 18y.

## Treatment

chemo-- PR -->pr(50 Gy IFRT)
```

# Results
| results | CHOP | +RT |
| ------- | ---- | --- |
| 5y OS   | 72   | 82  |
| 5y PFS  | 64   | 77  |
| 7y PFS  | =    | =   |
| 15y PFS | 40   | 40  |

- Post-hoc: IPI 0-1 did well with RT.
- Excessive late OOF failures occur in the CHOP x3c / IFRT arm.
- CHOP had more heart failure and inability to complete treatment.

>[!summary]
> - Adding RT to chemo improves PFS and OS compared to chemo alone at 5y, although OS benefit is lost at long-term F/U. This was the first study to demonstrate an OS benefit with chemo plus radiotherapy.
>- At about 7y, the curves cross and become NS. Most failures were outside the RT field. Does this suggest suboptimal chemo?

Modern guideline-recommended doses have decreased to 30 Gy, and ISRT is now utilized.
