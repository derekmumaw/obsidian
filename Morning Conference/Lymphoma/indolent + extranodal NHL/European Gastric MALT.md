- Triple therapy
	- PPI-Amox-Clarithromycin 
	- Clarithromycin-Omeprazole-Metronidazole if PCN-allergic

# Results
- CR 80% (n=116). 
	- Of those who achieved CR, EFS 98% (n=3/116).
	- Time to CR can be slow. 
		- 60% of CRs in 3 mo
		- 25% of CRs in 12 mo
		- 15% of CRs in >12 mo
- if residual disease: 100% achieved CR after 2nd line antibiotics
