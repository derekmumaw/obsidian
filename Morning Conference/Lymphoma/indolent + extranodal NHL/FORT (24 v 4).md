> 4/2 vs. 24/12 for FL or MZL.

# Study
## 548 pts/614 Sites
- 85% FL, 15% MZL.
- 60% stage I-II.
- 50% with either previous RT or chemo.
- 2006-2011.
- MFU 6y.

## Treatment
- Around 20% of pts rec'd systemic chemo before local progression.
- PTV = GTV + 3cm
	- OARs prioritized

# Results

| ----------- | --- | ----- |
| ORR         | 81  | 97    |

- Shorter TTP with 4 Gy (HR 3.42). ~OS.

>[!summary]
> 550 patients with mostly G1-2 FL were randomized to the [[UK Multicenter (Dose-reduction)]] 24/12 or [[Boom-Boom]] 4/2. 
> Results favored the 24/12 with better CR rates (50 vs 70) translating into a 20% 5y local progression advantage. Mild toxicity was about doubled in the 24 Gy group though. 
> [[Boom-Boom]] is an acceptable palliative regiment, but 24/12 is probably the better treatment
> Boom boom has 50% CR, 30% PR. Boom boom is not non-inferior to 24 Gy.
