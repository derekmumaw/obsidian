# Epidemiology
- 72k cases per year, 20k deaths.
	- Incidence has doubled since 1970.
	- 9th leading cause of cancer death
	- FL is most common #pimp
- Median age: 65, peak incidence >70
- M:F 1.26:1.

# Risk Factors
## Immune
- Immunodeficiency, autoimmune

## Environmental
- pesticides, solvents

## Viral
- EBV (NKT/Burkitt)
- HTLV-1, HHV-8
- HCV (DLBCL and splenic MZL)
- H pylori (gastric MALT)
- C. psittaci (orbital MALT)
- B. burgdorferi (skin MALT)
- C. jejuni (small bowel MALT)

## Misc
- RT with weak association,
- alkylating agents,
- previous CLL/Hairy cell (Richter's transformation to DLBCL in 5-10%).

# Anatomy
## Nodal
## Extranodal
- 33% of NHL
- more common with indolent NHL
- Thymus, spleen, tonsils, adenoids (Waldeyer's ring) > bone marrow, skin, CNS, ovary, testicle, ocular adnexa, liver, stomach, bowel, breast, and lung
- Waldeyers ring, spleen are extra_nodal_, but not extra_lymphatic_
- Discontinuous spread is more common than with Hodgkin's disease
	- Around 90% contiguous volumes with HL

## Bulky
- Bulky = 7 cm
- DLBCL 6-10 cm or 7.5 cm per [UNFOLDER] study
- Hodgkin's lymphoma 10 cm, 7 cm per MSKCC/DFCI, or 6 cm for children's HL per AHOD 0031 
- Follicular lymphoma 6 cm per [FLIPI-2]

# Pathology/Genetics
- B more common than T

## WHO 2016
### Folicular NHL
| Grade | number of centroblasts per HPF #pimp            |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| G1    | 0-5                                             |
| G2    | 6-15                                            |
| G3    | >15                                             |
| G3b   | G3 with sheets of centroblasts (treat as DLBCL) |

- t(14:18) → BCL-2 overexpression (blocks apoptosis)

#### GELF Criteria
- Helps med onc determine when to treat advanced follicular lymphoma.
- ≥ 3 nodal sites each ≥ 3 cm,
- any nodal or extranodal tumor mass ≥ 7 cm,
- B symptoms,
- splenomegaly > 16 cm,
- pleural effusions or peritoneal ascites,
- cytopenias (ANC < 1.5k or plt < 100),
- leukemia (>5 x10^9/L malignant cells).

### Marginal Zone
- both nodal and extranodal
- t(11:18)

### Mantle Cell
- t(11:14)
- Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) of childhood: CD30+ 100%, most have rearrangement of ALK gene.

# Presentation
- Usually only slow-growing lymphadenopathy
- see [[#GELF criteria]] above

# Workup
## H&P
- liver, spleen palpation
- Skin exam

## Labs
- CBC, ESR, CMP, LDH,
- peripheral smear
- HIV, HBV, HCV,
- beta2 microglobulin,
- urea breath test

## Imaging
- CT+ CAP
- PET/CT
	- >10 SUV suggests high-grade. Target biopsy here
- MRI brain/spine if symptomatic

## Procedures
- Biopsy of peripheral node ideal
	- endoscopic biopsy for gastric MALT
	- FNA not sufficient #emph 
- Bone marrow biopsy probably required (determines if stage IV)
- LP if testicular, paravertebral, parameningeal, positive bone marrow, HIV

# Prognostic Grouping
## Old Grouping: Low-high
| grade         | criterion                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Low           | G1-2 follicular, CLL/SLL, MZL/MALT                           |
| Int           | G3 follicular, mantle cell, GZL, DLBCL, T/NK cell, PTL, ALCL |
| High          | Burkitt's, lymphoblastic, double hit DLBCL                   |
| Miscellaneous | MF, Histiocytic, Extramedullary plasmacytoma                 |

## New Grouping (WHO 2016): Aggressive V Indolent
- basically: (DLBCL and G3 Follicular) vs. "the rest"
	- Burkitt's, lymphoblastic and double-hit DLBCL worse
- 70 distinct entities WHO 2016 does not attempt to differentiate into aggressive or indolent due to variable clinical behavior

## FLIPI: Follicular
[[FLIPI-2]]

## Misc
- Ki67
- IRF4 gene rearrangement

# Staging: _Ann Arbor_

| Stage     | Description                                                          |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stage I   | single node or group of nodes                                        |
| Stage II  | more than one site – all lesions either below or above the diaphragm |
| Stage III | both sides of diaphragm                                              |
| Stage IV  | Widespread extralymphoid sites ± lymph node involvement              |
_The suffix (E) to the numeral indicates Extranodal disease, (A) denotes absence of systemic symptoms, (B) presence of these (see above)._
- FL: mostly III-IV at presentation
- Marginal Zone: Stage I at presentation
- MALT: mostly I at presentation

    RT concurrently with DeVIC leads to favorable outcomes. 
- 358 pts from 31 institutes. Nasal NKT cell lymphoma. 72% localized. MFU 5.5y.
- RT DeVIC was utilized in 66% of localized cases. 
- L-asparaginase most commonly used for advanced, only 30%. 
- 5y OS for localized / advanced of 68→ 24%. 
- 5y OS for RT-DeVIC of 72%, 5y PFS 61%.
- IL-2 is a prognostic factor for worse OS and PFS.**

# Histology specific
## Gastric
- Staging: **AA** vs TNM vs Extension
	- none of this changes radiation treatment
- 30/20 because of nausea #pimp historically 
	- probably not true if you pretreat well
