# study
- 1093 newly diagnosed FL patients
- Risk factors (above) determined by bootstrap resampling 

# results

| 5y  | LR (0) | IR (1-2) | HR (3-5) |
| --- | ------ | -------- | -------- |
| OS  | 98     | 88       | 77       |
| PFS | 80     | 50       | 20         |

- See table above for 5y OS, which ranges from 100-80% for 0 and 3+ risk factors, respectively.

# TJQ
- HASSL mnemonic for FLIPI I

>[!summary] 
> - Study of 1000 patients with follicular lymphoma where they took all the data points they had, poured them into an algorithm which picked the best risk factors. 
> - They found beta2, BM, age, nodal size, and hemoglobin to be prognostic for OS and PFS and made low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk groups for patients with 0, 1-2, or 3-5 risk factors
> - Notably, the FLIPI-2 does not include grade, PET/CT CR, or stage II disease, which influences OS 
> - Doesn't include LDH, number of nodal sites, or stage (but Marrow matters).
