# Study
## 1,001 Pts
- Any stage receiving local therapy for definitive or curative treatment.
- 361 indolent sites (Follicular/MZL)
- 640 aggressive sites (DLBCL).
- 82% DLBCL, 67% Stage I-II.

## Treatment
- RT alone, chemoâ†’ RT, or palliation.
- 10% rec'd Ritux

# Results
## Indolent 
- 5y LC ~77%. 
	- sub-optimal LC rate: suggests 24 Gy may be inadequate 
		- Rituximab was not well utilized
		- NCCN recommends 24-30 Gy for indolent lymphomas
## Aggressive 
- 5y LC ~83% 
- 5y OS 66%.

>[!summary]
> 1000 patients with NHL were randomized to standard 40-45 Gy or dose-reduced 24/12 if indolent or 30/15 if aggressive. 
> Both indolent and aggressive cohorts seemed to respond equally to standard and dose-reduced with 5y-LC at around 80%. There were no OS or PFS differences either. 
> The indolent LC was felt to be a little low, but few patients had rituximab when this study was done.
