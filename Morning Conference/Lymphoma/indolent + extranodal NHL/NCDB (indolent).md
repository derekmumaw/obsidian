> Chemo ± RT.

# Study
## 35,961 Pts
- Stage I-II G1-2 follicular lymphoma
	- Stage I in 60%
- 1998-2012

# Results

| results | Chemo | +RT |
| ------- | ----- | --- |
| 5y-OS   | 74    | 86  |
| 10y-OS  | 54    | 68  |

- RT use from 1999 to 2012 declined from 37→ 24%.
	- Rituximab was approved in 1997.
- The use of RT is lowest in patients under the age of 45 and over the age of 75.
- Patients with the lowest burden of comorbidities stand to benefit the most from curative treatment.

>[!summary]
> 36k patients in an NCDB analysis looking at chemo ± RT.
> The results favored RT with an ~13% OS advantage to adding RT even out to 10y.
> Other interesting trends were that RT use declined about 15% after rituximab was approved and that RT tends to be avoided in young patients and used in older patients
