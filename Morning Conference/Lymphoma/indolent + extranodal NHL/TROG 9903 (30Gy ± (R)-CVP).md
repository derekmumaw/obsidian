>[!intervention]
> 30 Gy IFRT ± (R)-CVP x6c.

# Study
## 150 Pts
- Stage I-II FL, G1-2
	- 75% stage I
- 50% PET/CT staged
- 2000-2012
- MFU 10y

## Treatment
- 30 Gy IFRT
- Cyclophosphamide 1000 d1, Vincristine 1.4 d1, Prednisolone 50 d1-5, Rituximab 375 d1 x6c.
	- only 40% got Ritux

# Results

| 10y     | 30 Gy | R-CVP |
| ------- | ----- | ----- |
| PFS     | 41    | 59    |
| OS      | 90    | 90    |
| → DLBCL | 10    | 10     |

- rituximab appeared to be driving the PFS advantage (event though only 40% got it) 
	- ~15% PFS advantage of R-CVP/IFRT vs CVP/IFRT 

>[!summary]
> 150 patients with early stage indolent FL who were treated to 30 Gy of IFRT with or without chemo, CPhos, Vincristine, and Prednisolone with about 40% also getting Rituximab. 
> Overall, there was about a 20% advantage to adding chemo, but it seemed like it was being driven by the rituximab.
