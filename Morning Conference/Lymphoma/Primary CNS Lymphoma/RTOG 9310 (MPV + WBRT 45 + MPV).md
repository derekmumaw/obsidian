>[!intervention]
> MPV x5c → WBRT (45/25 or 36/30 BID - 1.2 Gy) → Ara-C x2c.

# Study
## 98 Pts
- immunocompetent
- newly diagnosed PCNSL
- 40% above the age of 60

## Treatment
- MVP x5c (MTX 2.5, Procarbazine, Vincristine). IT MTX 12 mg between cycles. 
- Only 16 pts got BID RT, while 63 pts got 45 Gy.

# Results
## Response
- 58% CR, 36% PR.
	- CR did not influence survival outcomes.

## Survival
- 2y OS 64%, 5y OS 32%. MS 3y.
- 2y PFS 50%
- MS for < 60y / > 60y of 50→ 22 mo.

## Tox
- Severe delayed neurotoxicity (clinically diagnosed leukoencephalopathy) for ± 60y of 14→ 19%. Half were G5.
- G3+ 73% (2/3 related to myelosuppression).
- G5 10% (6→ 16% for > 60y)

>[!summary]
> - 45/30 switched to 36/30 BID (1.2 Gy) due to late toxicity, and was just as effective. 
> - This trial likely resulted in less patients above the age of 60 getting WBRT for PCNSL.
> - **Modern, preferred regimen** (not recognized as top option in NCCN 5.2020): 
> 	- ~60% CR after 5c R-MPV. 
> 	- ~80% CR after 7c R-MPV. 
> 	- If CR → 23.4 Gy WBRT (per [[MSK (MPV + WBRT 23.6 + Ara-C)|MSK]]) 
> 	- If PR after 7c → 30-36 Gy WBRT ± 45 Gy GTV boost → Ara-C x2c.
