>[!intervention]
> HDMTX x6c {Â± 45/30 WBRT}

# Study
## 551 Pts (318 per protocol)
- immunocompetent
- MFU 7y

## Treatment
- 2000-2009
	- 2000-2006: HD-MTX 4 q2w
	- 2007-2009: Added ifosfamide. No WBRT arm got Ara-C if no CR
- 80% did not get ifosfamide

# Results
## Response
- CR 35%, PR 19%
	- _Much lower CR than other trials._

- MS ~36 mo.
- Trend to OS for < CR with addition of WBRT, HR 0.74 (p=0.10).
>[!summary]
> This trial used MTX monotherapy and had much lower CR than other trials (typically, 50-70% CR). There is a suggestion of worsening OS with the omission of WBRT. Suggested higher neurotoxicity with WBRT. Lower dose WBRT might have provided better outcomes.
"The role of WBRT is controversial because delayed neurotoxicity limits its acceptance as standard of care"
>^summary

# KCL
- Endpoint: OS (non-inferiority)
- Conclusions (as written): safe to omit because there was no OS difference
	- Even though it was a non-inferiority trial. 
	- Can't make that conclusion. (and PFS benefit suggests a benefit to WBRT)
