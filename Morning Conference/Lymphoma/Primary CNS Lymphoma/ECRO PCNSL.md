# Epi
- 1,000 cases per year
	- 4 per million
	- 4% of primary brain tumors
- Median age overall of 55-65y
- 3 fold increase over the past 30y!
- LMD/CSF+ in 33% at dx. Retinal and vitreous seeding in 15-20% at time of dx
	- Do a slit-lamp ocular examination!
- EBV is present in 65% of immunodeficient, and 15% immunocompetent.

## Immunocompetent
- Peak age in 70s
- M:F 2:1
- Up to 50% multifocal on imaging, though > 90% multifocal microscopically

## Immunodeficient
- median age 35
- M:F > 9:1 (95% males)
- Up to 80% multifocal (100% if AIDS).

# Risk Factors
## Immunodeficiency
- Iatrogenic immunosuppression
- SCID, Wiskott-Aldrich, ataxia-telangiectasia, common variable immunodeficiency
- ? Autoimmune disease?

### AIDS
- AIDS defining illness
- HIV → 3600x risk of developing PCNSL
- Usually 100% associated with EBV
- non-CNS NHL with AIDS: 30-50%
	- Only 2-13% of AIDS develop PCNSL
- More likely to be multifocal if immunodeficient
- AIDS pts may have smaller ring-enhancing lesions, DDx = toxoplasmosis.

# Anatomy
## Presentations
- intracranial
- Leptomeningial
- Periventricular
- Vitreous
- spinal

## Subsites
- 90% supratentorial
	- Typically frontal lobe, deep white matter, periventricular.
- Frontal > parietal > temporal > BG > CC > cerebellum > brainstem > insula > occipital > fornix

## Focality
- 2/3 - 3/4 present with solitary mass.
	- Up to 50% microscopically multifocal if immunocompetent,
	- basically 100% microscopically multifocal if AIDS
- 20% synchronous ocular involvement.
- < 5% of pts present with isolated spinal cord/meningeal involvement (lower cervical or upper thoracic)

## Systemic Lymphoma
- > 95% of Pts with PCNSL have Negative Lymphoma Workup
- If systemic lymphoma is present, assume secondary CNS involvement.
- High risk features from CNS mets from NHL: Burkitt, lymphoblastic lymphoma, immunocompromised, BM+, parameningeal presentation (NPX, PNS), testicular relapse.

# Pathology
- 90-95% DLBCL. 5-10% burkitt, lymphoblastic, marginal, T-cell
- All are stage IE. Systemic NHL is often associated with orbital lymphoma.
- B cells are typically not present in CNS.
	- "Perivascular cuffing": Classic description of neoplastic B lymphocytes.

| Marker      | Cell                        |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| CD 19/20/22 | B cells                     |
| BCL-6       | germinal center B-cells     |
| IRF4/MUM1   | Late germinal center B-cell |

# Workup
## H&P
- testicular exam (testicular U/S for men > 60y), neuro exam, LN exam.
- Ddx: Metastatic lymphoma (~5%), CNS tumors, mets, abscess, hemorrhage, MS, sarcoidosis, toxo (AIDS).

## Labs
- LDH, EBV, HIV, toxo (ELISA for antibody). #pimp
- AIDS patients: Toxoplasmosis titer and BMBx.

## Procedures
### Lumbar Puncture
- LP increased protein (85%), β2 microglobulin, and LDH; low glucose (33%).
- Flow cytometry, etc.

### Slit Lamp Eye Exam: (vitrectomy if positive)
- Important for RT fields.
- If CNS+ -> 15-20% ocular involvement
- If ocular+ -> 75% CNS involvement
- If initially involved, slit-lamp before and after chemo

## Imaging
### MRI Brain
- "cotton wool" appearance, (homogenous with fuzzy borders)
- Indistinct fluffy borders, strong contrast enhancement, ring enhancement esp in AIDS (central necrosis), T2 iso/hypointense, less edema than expected for glioma or mets.
- know low-B vs. high-B #pimp

### MRI Spine: if Sx or CSF Positive
- ~30% with LMD or CSF involvement at diagnosis.
	- If MRI and LP diagnostic, no biopsy necessary per NCCN.

### PET/CT > CT C/A/P
- Systemic disease is only found in ~8% at diagnosis.

## Biopsy
- Stereotactic needle biopsy, ocular biopsy, CSF cytology
- no clinical benefit to surgical resection
- Hold steroids until after biopsy.
	- If bx non-diagnostic on steroids, discontinue and re-biopsy on progression.

# Prognostic Factors
- Poor response to chemo, AIDS (OR 3.6k), multifocality, Age, poor KPS, LDH, CSF protein, deep location.
	- "Good risk" immunocompromised include AIDS with CD4 > 200.
## IELSG
- Ferreri JCO '03
- RF (1pt per): Age > 60, ECOG ≥ 2, LDH, high CSF protein, deep location (periventricular, BG, stem, CBL).

| 2y          | 0-1 | 2-3 | 4-5 |
| ----------- | --- | --- | --- |
| OS          | 80  | ~50 | 15% |
| OS + HD-MTX | 85  | 87  | 24% |

## MSKCC RPA 
- Abrey JCO '06
- Patients under the age of 50 do best with a MS of nearly 10y.

| years                | MS   | FFS  |
| -------------------- | ---- | ---- |
| 1: < 50y             | 8.5  | 2    |
| 2: > 50y + KPS > 70% | 3.2  | 1.8  |
| 3: > 50y + KPS < 70% | 1.1y | 0.6y |

## Survival
- Unlike extranodal NHL (response of 90%), PCNSL is very radioresistant after RT alone (5y OS 4%)
	- Long term survival becomes 15-20% when using MTX-based chemo ± RT.
- Ocular lymphoma is uniformly fatal. MS 6-18 mo.

| Treatment    | MS (m) |
| ------------ | ------ |
| No tx        | 1.5    |
| WBRT         | 10-18  |
| Chemo ± WBRT | 44     |

- 3y OS now nearly 90% with MS 6y for those who achieve CR (~60% after 5c R-MPV, ~80% after 7c R-MPV).

## Follow up
- Assess response with MRI brain < 2 mo post-tx. Repeat LP and/or slit lamp if initially positive.

| Response        | Follow up strategy                                                                           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CR:             | No steroids, normal slit lamp, LP and MRI.                                                   |
| Unconfirmed CR: | Any steroids, minor slit lamp finding, negative CSF, Minor MRI enhancement.                  |
| PR:             | Slit lamp w decrease in vitreous cells/retinal infiltrate, LP+, ≥ 50% decreased enhancement. |
| PD:             | New ocular dz, LP+, ≥ 25% increase in enhancement or new lesion/site.                        |

# Treatment
## RT
[[RTOG 8315 (WBRT 60Gy alone)]]: Historical. Pt's did very poorly without chemo. Failures 90% in-field even with 60 Gy.

==RTOG 8806==: PII. 54pts. Cphose, dox, vinc, dexameth. IT MTX if CSF+. 41.4/1.8. Slightly better OS compared to 8315.  

[[G-PCNSL-SG-1 (chemo ± WBRT)]]: Chemo alone has worse 2y-PFS by about 15%. Non-inferiority trial.

[[RTOG 9310 (MPV + WBRT 45 + MPV)]]: Now with 5-7 cycles of MTX/Procarbazine/Vincristine before RT and 2 cycles of AraC after. 60% CR after 5 cycles, 80% after 7. Much better control rates, but Toxicity was pretty severe and much worse for >60y. 

[[MSK (R-MPV + WBRT 23.6 + Ara-C)]]: Like 9310, but they added rituximab and then, if they had a complete response, they reduced the WBRT dose to 23.4/13.
