> HD-MTX-based chemo→ {WBRT vs. ASCT}

# Study
## 97 Patients
- 18-60 years.
- MFU 8y.

## Treatment
- HD-MTX-based chemo: Rituximab, Methotrexate, BCNU, VP16, prednisone x2c→ Ritxumab/cytarabine x2c

# Results

| 8y           | WBRT | ASCT |
| ------------ | ---- | ---- |
| EFS          | 39   | 67   |
| OS           | 65   | 69   |
| G5           | 4    | 5    |
| Balance tox  | 52   | 10   |
| Neurocog tox | 64   | 13     |

- In the ASCT arm, treatment-related death was 11% while a third of relapses were successfully salvaged after WRBT.

>[!summary]
> This trial did not evaluate reduced dose WBRT in the setting of complete response (only 46% of patients had CR in the WBRT arm, which appears inferior to CR rates with R-MPV x5-7 cycles).

TBL [QS](http://www.quadshotnews.blogspot.com/2022/07/precisely.html): In long-term follow up of the PRECIS trial, ASCT results in less neurocognitive toxicity and a lower risk of relapse with no difference in overall survival.
