> R-MPV x5-7c + WBRT (45/30 if PR, 23.4/13 if CR) → Ara-C x2c.

# 2007
## 2007 Study
### 30 Pts
### Treatment
- (Rituximab, MTX 3.5, Procarbazine, Vincristine) x5c q2w
	- if CSF+: IT MTX 12 mg between cycles
- PR: WBRT to 45 Gy (from [[RTOG 9310 (MPV + WBRT 45 + MPV)]])
- CR: WBRT dose reduction to 23.4 due to high rates of severe neurotoxicity in pts > 60y who rec'd 45 Gy in earlier trials

## 2007 Results
- 2y OS 67%.
- CR 67%.
	- → 19 pts 23.4 Gy
		- 2y OS 89%, 2y PFS 79%
- No major neurotoxicity, in fact improvements in all tested domains.

# 2013
## 2013 Study
### 52 Pts
- Median age 60.
- Median KPS 70.

## 2013 Results
- CR in 60%.
	- 50% CR after 5c, 80% CR after 7c
	- 16% PR (95% any response)
- CR (i.e. 23.4 Gy):
	- 2y PFS 77%
		- MPFS 7.7y
	- 5y OS 80%
		- MS NR (6y+)
- Elderly pts with MS 5.5y. Previously reported to be 1-1.5y MS

### Toxicity
- At baseline, cognitive impairment evidence across several domains
- After induction chemo: significant improvement in executive and verbal memory
- No evidence of significant cognitive decline during follow-up, except for motor speed.

>[!summary]
> Reduced dose WBRT to 23.4 Gy and Ara-C x2 after R-MPV x5-7c has good control and minimal neurotoxicity.
About half of patients will have CR after 5c of R-MPV, while CR after 7c 80%. Also, 5y OS is 80%!
