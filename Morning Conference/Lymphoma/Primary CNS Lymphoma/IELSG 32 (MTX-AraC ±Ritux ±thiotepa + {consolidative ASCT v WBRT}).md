>[!intervention]
> MTX-Ara-C x4c {± Ritux {± Thiotepa}} → {ASCT vs. WBRT}.

# Study
## 227 Pts
- immunocompetent

## Treatment
- MTX 3.5, Ara-C {± Rituxan 375 {± Thiotepa 30}}. Q3w.
- RT: 36/20 WBRT + 9 Gy for PR (46%).
	- Orbital shielding after 30 Gy (or 36 Gy if intraocular dz).

# Results
- chemo randomizations: 30 mo cCR 23 → 30 → 49% 

| results         | ASCT | WBRT |
| --------------- | ---- | ---- |
| 2y PFS (p=0.17) | 69   | 80   |

- More heme toxicity with ASCT and two infectious deaths
- Worse attentiveness/executive functions with WBRT (improved with ASCT, also improved QOL)

# KCL
- Need to know study (Randomized comparison of chemos)
- Thioteva + rituxan is the winner even on the most recent 2021 analysis
- ASCT and WBRT remain comparable
	- WBRT with more neurotox long-term

>[!summary]
Addition of Ritux and Thiotepa to MTX/Ara-C does best! 
Lower dose WBRT might have produced more favorable outcomes. Although results were not significant, there was a slight trend in PFS benefit with WBRT. Nearly half received 45 Gy for partial response. 
This group previously found no role in increasing dose beyond 36 Gy in the context of CR [Ferreri IJROBP '11](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360301610002695).
