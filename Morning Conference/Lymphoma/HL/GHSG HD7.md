# study
- 650 favorable pts. MFU 10y.

# results

| results | +ABVD | -ABVD |
| ------- | ----- | ----- |
| 7y FFTF | 67    | 88    |
| 7y OS   | 93    | 93    |
| 15y PFS | 52    | 73    |

- ==15%== secondary malignancies in each arm at long term follow up!
- Second neoplasia without prior progression or relapse of HL ~12%.

>[!summary] 
> - ABVD improves outcomes in early-stage disease 
> - Like [HD 10] which was for early stage, there were no differences in second neoplasias at long term follow up
