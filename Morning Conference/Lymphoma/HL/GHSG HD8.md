# study
- ~1,000 pts
- unfavorable disease  
- Stage I and II 
- MFU 12.7y

# results
| results                          | EFRT | IFRT |
| -------------------------------- | ---- | ---- |
| overall second neoplasia rate    | 15   | 15   |
| second neoplasia (HL controlled) | 14   | 9    |
| deaths due to ^                  | 5.3  | 3.4  |
 
- Elderly (>60y) subset did worse with EFRT in 5y FFTF and OS

>[!summary] 
> - IFRT is noninferior to EFRT. No differences in OS or second neoplasias seen in the long term.
> - Subset analysis demonstrated > 60y is an important prognostic factor
