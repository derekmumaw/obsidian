# Epidemiology
- 8.5k annual incidence, 1k deaths
	- 0.6% all ne cancers
	- 10% of all lymphomas
	- 6% of childhood cancers.
- M/F ratio
	- 2.5:1 for children < 5y
	- 1:1 for children 15-19y
- Bimodal: 15-35 and >50
	- Most common in 10-19 years, rare among children < 4y.
- First degree relatives have 5x risk for HL
	- Siblings with 2-5x increased risk, if same-sex 9 fold risk.

# Risk Factors
- EBV
	- 60% of childhood HL cases
		- 5% if < 10yo, 20% otherwise.
	- → mixed cellularity subtype
- history of mono

# Anatomy
- Nodal disease with predictable spread
- Extranodal disease is rare
	- most commonly spleedn
- 80% with cervical nodes, 50% with mediastinal nodes
- 13 lymphatic regions (AA)
	- ![[img_ECRO HL_nodal-regions.png#invert]]

# Pathology
- Reed-Sternberg cells are the tumor cells
	- but only account for 1-2% of volume (infiltrating lymphocytes, etc.)

## Subtypes
### Classic
- 95%.
- RS cells
- CD15/30+

| 30m | NS  | MC  | LR  | LD  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EFS | 89  | 86  | 97  | 55  |
| OS  | 97  | 94  | 97  | 87  |

#### Nodular Sclerosing
- 70%
- Mediastinum. 26yo. 33% B symptoms

#### Mixed Cellularity
- 20%
- worse prognosis. Often abdominal involvement or advanced disease at presentation
- Older, male patients. 33% B symptoms
- EBV/AIDS association

#### Lymphocyte Rich
- 5%
- Best prognosis. Typically early stage.
- 30 yo. Males. 10% B symptoms

#### Lymphocyte Depleted
- <5%
- Worst prognosis. Usually advanced disease at presentation
- Older, male patients. 66% B symptoms

### Nodular-lymphocytic Predominate
- 5%
- more similar to low-grade NHL.
- No reed-sternberg cells, CD30-
- high rate of transformation to DLBCL

# Presentation
- painless adenopathy
- generalized pruritis
- alcohol-induced pain in involved sites

## B Symptoms
- night sweats
- fever > 38C
- Weightloss >10% in 6 months

# Prognosis
- stage, age, ESR, # of nodal sites, ENE, bulk
- Early stage favorable: 95% cure rate.
- Advanced stage: 80-90% cure rate, PFS 90%.

## Unfavorable Factors
### GHSG
- ESR >50 with no B symptoms
- ESR >30 with B symptoms
- Bulk > 33% ITT
- > 2 nodal sites
- any extranodal

### EORTC
- ESR >50 with no B symptoms
- ESR >30 with B symptoms
- Bulk > 35% ITT
- > 3 nodal sites
- 50+ yo

### NCCN
- ESR >50
- B symptoms
- Bulk > 33% ITT or >10cm
- > 3 nodal sites

## IPS
SHAM-LAW
- Serum Albumin <4
- Hgb <10.5
- Age 45+
- Male gender
- leukocytes >15k
- AA IV
- lymphocytes <600 or <8% of white count

# Workup
## Procedures
- Excisional LN biopsy. 
	- Core OK, not FNA as it does not show LN architecture
- BMBx for cytopenias if present (per NCCN) or B symptoms, stage III-IV, bulky or recurrent disease.
	- controversial when already staged with PET/CT

## Imaging
- PET/CT
	- Only 15-20% will have stage IV disease.

## Labs
- Albumin, pregnancy test, HIV, HBV, HCV.

## Other
- Fertility: 2 Gy permanent, 0.5 Gy transient for sperm. 8-10 Gy permanent for oocytes.
- Dental eval.
- PFTs if ABVD or BEACOPP given (Bleomycin).
- MUGA before ABVD.
- Vaccines if splenic RT.
