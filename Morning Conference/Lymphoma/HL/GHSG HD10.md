# study
## 1470 pts. 
- Early stage, favorable. 
    - Recall: GHSG utilizes two or less nodal sites
- Only 7.5% B symptoms 
- No PET imaging on this study! 
- MFU 8.2y

# results
- No differences between chemo or RT randomizations control rates
	- 5y PFS ~91-94%. 5y OS ~97%.
	- 10y PFS ~87%, 10y OS ~94%.
- Worse toxicity with 30 Gy
	- More dysphagia 2→ 3% and mucositis 0.7→ 3.4% with 30 Gy.
	- No difference in secondary malignancy at 10 years.

>[!summary] 
> - 2c ABVD and 20 Gy for favorable early stage HL is similar to the historical standard of ABVD x4 and IFRT of 30 Gy. 
> - 2c ABVD and 20 Gy is the favored treatment for favorable early stage HL. 
> 	- Still, many med oncs try to omit RT with more chemo despite the fact that each additional cycle of adriamycin appears as detrimental as 5 Gy mean heart dose. 
> - Caveat: This trial was not in the PET era. PET-era trials show PFS detriment when omitting RT in the setting of PET2on [HD16] and [H10F] or PET3on [RAPID].
