# study
## 1400 patients
- early stage 
- unfavorable
- MFU 8.8y.

# results
| Results         | 20 Gy | 30 Gy |
| --------------- | ----- | ----- |
| 10y PFS BEACOPP | 84    | 84    |
| 10y PFS ABVD    | 76    | 84    |
| G3+             | 6     | 12    |

- no difference in control rates between BEACOPP and ABVD
- can get away with BEACOPP → 20 Gy
- But, do not use 20 Gy after ABVD x4c
- G3+ for ABVD / BEACOPP of 52→ 74%. 
- No difference at secondary malignancy at 10y.

>[!summary] 
> - The subsequent [HD14] utilized a "hybrid" 2+2 regimen which is now the European standard of care for UIR per [HD17].
> - Superiority of BEACOPP over ABVD was not observed in these early stage unfavorable patients. 
> - RT de-escalation for unfavorable HL depends on chemo: 
> 	- ABVD x4c→ 30 Gy 
> 	- BEACOPP x4c→ 20 Gy
> - No differences in OS or second neoplasias seen in the long term.
> - PET-era trials showed PFS detriment when omitting RT in the setting of PET3 D1-2 on [RAPID].
