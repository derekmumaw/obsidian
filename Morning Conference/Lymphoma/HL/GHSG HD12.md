# Study
## 1670 Patients
- IIBX-III/IV.
- MFU 12y.

## Treatment
- RT indications: 
	- Bulky disease 5+ cm
		- even if randomized to no RT, if <50% response (11%), all got RT
	- Residual lesions ≥ 1.5 cm
- CR: disappearance of all measurable disease.

# Results
## Control
- 5y FFTF improved with RT if given for residual disease, but not for bulky
	- translates to a 10y PFS benefit of 7% for RT for residual disease 
- no OS difference for RT or chemo randos

>[!summary]
> - Do not omit RT for residual disease, but RT may be omitted in CT-based CR even with initially bulky disease.
> - Non-inferiority of 4+4 was shown in long term follow up.
