# study
- 334 patients
	- stage III-IV
	- OC, OP (30%), HPX, LX
	- pT3/4 Nx (except T3N0 larynx). 
	- SM- if pT1/2 pN2/3. 
	- Lower stage with PNI, ENE, SM+ (28%), or vascular tumor embolism eligible. 
	- OC/OP with level IV or V LN.
	- MFU 60 mo.
- Treatment
	- 66 Gy to primary, 54 Gy to low risk volumes
		- 91% of patients received 66 Gy. 
	- ± CisP

> How should we manage operable locally-advanced OC?
> - like [[RTOG 9501 (adjRT ± chemo)|RTOG 9501]], per EORTC 22931, with adjuvant RT and concurrent chemo. 
> - They randomized 330 patients with various H&N cancers with close/+ SM, ENE, cLN+ IV/V, PNI, vascular embolism to 66 Gy ± concurrent CisP. 
> - Again, the results clearly favored the addition of chemo with a 13% improvement in LRC and OS at 5 years.
