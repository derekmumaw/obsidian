# study
- 164 patients
	- T1-2 N0.
	- OC database.
	- Observational cohort after surgery.
# results
| 5y             | iLND+pGlos -> no RT | 
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| LRFS           | 89%                 |
| RRFS           | 80%                 |
| DSS            | 86%                 |
| i RR           | 60%                 |
| c RR           | 40%                 |
| Thickness >4mm | 24%                 |
| Thickness <4mm | 6%                  |
- 66% of patients with a neck recurrence could not be salvaged.

> When can we omit RT? Do we need to also treat the contralateral neck?
> - When DOI is > 4mm. Princess Margaret and MSKCC answered this question with an observational study of 160 early stage patients with up to T2N0 disease. 
> - They found that with only a partial glossectomy and ipsilateral neck dissection, regional failure was pretty high, even in the contralateral neck at 40%. 2/3rds of these recurrences couldn't be salvaged. *Suggests need to treat bilateral neck*
> - The biggest risk factor for failure was 4mm of *tumor thickness*. 
>^summary

# notes
- high contralateral failure rates suggests need to treat bilateral neck. 
	- This contrasts with the UF data [Amdur](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30234502/) 
		- population: DOI >4mm, but no crossing of midline
		- results: no contralateral failures 
- recent [Ebrahimi](https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/6563806#free-full-text) data suggests that DOI alone shouldn't be used to decide on RT
