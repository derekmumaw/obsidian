# study
- 721 pts. 
	- Stage IV OC 
	- 80% betel nut users. 
	- 70% buccal mucosa.
	- T4a ~75%. T4b ~25%. 
	- N2b+ 75%.
	- 2008-2012. 
- Induction chemo
	- Typically TPF, but carboplatin may be substituted for CDDP, and 90% omitted 5-FU.
	- 85% of patients completed 2 cycles.
- RT
	- POCCRT to 66 Gy, CCRT 70 Gy w cisplatin 30 qweek.
	- Palliative RT at 40/16 or 30/10.

Non-surgical treatment most commonly palliative RT, not CCRT.

>[!summary] 
> How should Locally Advanced/inoperable cases be handled? 
> - Patil at Tata Memorial gives us an approach involving induction chemo. 
> - 721 patients with inoperable, stage IV disease were treated with 2c of induction TPF. 43% converted to operable. The remaining underwent either definitive CCRT or, more likely palliative RT. 
> - If you look at the subset who completed 2 cycles of the full 3 drug regimen, 66% achieved resectability which was important because the LRC was doubled and the MS was tripled with surgery.
