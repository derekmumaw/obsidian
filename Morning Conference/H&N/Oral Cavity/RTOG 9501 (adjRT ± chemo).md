> Adj RT [± Chemo]

# Study
- 416 pts.
	- OC, OP (42%), larynx, HPX.
	- 2+ LN, ENE, or SM+ (18%).
- Treatment
	- 60 Gy with optional 6Gy boost in 30-33 fractions
		- 13% of patients received 66 Gy.
	- ± CisP. 

# Results

| 3y       | RT  | + chemo |
| -------- | --- | ------- |
| LRC      | 67  | 78      |
| DFS      | 36  | 47      |
| OS       | 47  | 56      |
| DM       | 20  | 20      |
| aG3+     | 34  | 77      |
| Late tox | =   | =       |

- For ECE and/or SM+:

| 10y | RT  | + chemo |
| --- | --- | ------- |
| LRC | 21  | 33      |
| DFS | 12  | 18      |
| OS  | 20  | 27      |

# Notes
- #txit for ECE and/or SM+: CisP improved LC and DFS (only trend for OS)

> How should we manage operable locally-advanced OC?
> - like [[EORTC 22931 (adjRT ± chemo)|EORTC 22931]], per RTOG 9501, with adjuvant RT and concurrent chemo.
> - They randomized 400 patients with a variety of H&N malignancies, including OC, with 2+ LNs, ENE, or +SM to 60 Gy ± CisP.
> - The results clearly favored the addition of chemo with a 10% improvement in 3y LRC and DFS, and a trend towards OS benefit. This did come at the cost of a doubling in aG3+ toxicity.
