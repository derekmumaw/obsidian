> Primary resection (OC/OP) pT1-2â†’ [LND] vs. [SLNB] (if negative, observation)  

# study
- 279 patients.
	- T1-T2 OC or OP.
- Intervention
	- Sentinel node staging by lymphoscintigraphy prior to surgery.
	- SLND+ patients had immediate (if frozen +) or delayed (if final +) nodal dissection.

# results

> How should we address the neck in early stage disease?
> - The Senti-MERORL trial by Garrel would suggest that a SLNBx is just as good as a full LND. 
> - They randomized 280 patients with up to T2N0 disease to these two treatments. 
> - The results showed equivalent control out to 5 years, but improved acute functional outcomes. Also, only a third of the SLN group had to get a full dissection.
> - [[HN006 (-PET, SNLBx v ELND)|HN006]] is looking at this question too
