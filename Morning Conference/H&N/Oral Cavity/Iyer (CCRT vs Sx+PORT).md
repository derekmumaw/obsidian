>[!summary]
> Does surgery add anything to definitive chemoRT?
>- The Iyer trial tested the value of surgery in addition to 66 Gy of RT in 120 patients with Stage III/IV disease (1/3 of which had OC). They were randomized to either CCRT or Surgery followed by RT. 
>- The results pretty clearly favored the addition of surgery with a 10% increase in both OS and DSS in all patients and a dramatic 6x improvement in DSS for OC specifically. 
>- However, 66 Gy is a little low for modern standards and so was the Cisplatin dose.

# notes
- Low cisplatin dose ([[ECRO Oral Cavity#Chemo]])
- 66Gy is a low dose (we shoot for 70Gy)
- UF retromolar trigone data ([Hitchcock 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25456514/))
