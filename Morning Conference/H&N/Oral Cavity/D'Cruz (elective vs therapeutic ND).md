# study
- 500 pts.
	- T1-2N0 lateralized OC.
- Intervention
	- Therapeutic: close surveillance -> only dissect when patients become cN+
	- e.g. Salvage vs Adjuvant RT in prostate
- PORT indications:
	- pN+, primary DOI ≥ 10mm, SM+.

# results
| 3y results       | Salvage | Elective |
| ---------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| OS               | 68          | 80       |
| DFS              | 46          | 70       |
| Nodal recurrence | 74          | 31       |
| LR               | 28          | 5        |
| AE               | 3.3         | 6.6      |
    
- TND arm mostly cervical LN relapse, with around 50% dying of disease progression.
- pN+ in 30% of END arm, correlating to DOI 3 / 4 mm with pN+ of 6→ 17%. #emph  
	- There may not be a benefit for END in pts with DOI ≤ 3 mm.
	- A higher proportion of elective iLND pts rec'd adjuvant RT based on nodal indications.

>[!summary] 
> Should we be doing ENDs on everyone or just using it as salvage? What are indications for END? 
> - D'Cruz tested this with 500 patients with early stage OC who underwent resection ± PORT. 
> - the results **favored elective dissection**, ==especially when DOI > 3mm==  where the node positivity was found to be 20%. 
> - Furthermore, 3y-DFS was under 50% showing that the salvage dissection just isn't that effective
>^summary
# notes
- Need to distinguish tumor thickness from DOI.
- END indicated for DOI >= 3mm
- Not everyone needs a neck dissection. But definitely if they have DOI 4+ mm
