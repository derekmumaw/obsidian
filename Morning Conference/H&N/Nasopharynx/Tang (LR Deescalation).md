> RT ± concurrent CisP

# study
- 341 patients
	 - low-risk NPC 
	 	- stage II/T3N0M0 without adverse features: 
			- All nodes < 3 cm 
			- no level IV/Vb nodes
			- no ENE
			- EBV DNA < 4,000 copies/mL
	- Primary endpoint was 3y FFS with non inferiority margin of 10%. 
	- MFU 46 mo.
- Treatment
	- IMRT: 68-70 @ 2-2.2 Gy/d
	- ± Cisp 100mg/m2 q3w

# results

| 3y   | RT  | + CC |
| ---- | --- | ---- |
| G3/4 | 17  | 46   |

- 3y FFS (91) OS (98), LRR (7), DM (3) all equivalent
- QOL significantly better with RT alone 
	- global health status, social functioning, fatigue, N/V, pain, insomnia, appetite loss, and constipation.

>[!summary] 
> With modern staging and treatment techniques, do we still benefit from CCRT? (see [[Chen (II, RT ± concurrent)]] for prior SOC)
> - Tang randomized 350 patients with Stage II disease who had no adverse features, namely: nodes >3cm, inferior neck nodes, ENE, or non-EBV driven. They underwent IMRT with or without concurrent CisP.
> - with modern staging and treatment techniques, this low-risk cohort showed no difference in FFS, OS, LRR, or DM but toxicity was cut in third and QOL was better on pretty much every domain.
