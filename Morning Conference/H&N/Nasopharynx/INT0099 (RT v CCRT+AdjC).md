# study
- 147 pts. 
	- T3-4, N+
	- stage III/IV
	- Most WHO I/II (60%) (i.e. not Asian)

- Treatment
	- 3D RT: 
		- Gross: 70 Gy
		- nodes < 2 cm: 66 Gy
		- ENI 50 Gy 
	- Chemo: 
		- Concurrent: CDDP 100 q3w x3c 
		- Adjuvant: CDDP 80 + 5FU 1g infusion for 96h q4w x3c 
		- **6c total**

# results
| 3y  | RT  | ==+ CC/AdjC== |
| --- | --- | ------------- |
| OS  | 47  | ==78==        |
| PFS | 24  | ==69==        |
| LF  | 33  | ==10==        |
| RF  | 15  | ==9==         |
| DM  | 35  | ==13==        |

- * Other studies show 3y OS ~60% for RT alone.
- * Even in this non-EBV population, DM failure rate > Local failure (suggests benefit to induction chemo)

# notes
- practice changing (need to know) #emph 
- looking for a few percent advantage when making changes, but this difference was massive!

>[!summary] 
> If concurrent chemo benefits early stage disease, surely it also benefits advanced disease, especially if you also add in adjuvant chemo, right? 
> - Absolutely. The INT0099 is a landmark study which is especially notable because of the predominately EBV- population. They randomized 150 node postive, T3/4 patients to RT alone or ChemoRT with adjuvant chemo for a total of 6 cycles. 
> - It'd be hard to find a study of this type with more dramatic results. The OS increased by 30% and the PFS nearly tripled. Both Local and Distant failures both fell about 20%. It's worth noting that the RT alone numbers are unusually low compared to other studies. 
> - Interestingly, even in this EBV- population, the modes of failure were ever so slightly skewed towards distant metastases which gives us some suggestion that induction chemo may be beneficial in this population too.
