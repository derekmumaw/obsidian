# study
- Meta analysis
	- 26 trials
	- 7080 patients
	- Eligible
		- RT alone v CCRT 
		- CCRT v iC->RT v RT->aC
		- M0

# results
- 5y OS benefit for addition of any type of chemo: 6.3%. 
- 5y OS benefit for CCRT -> aC: 12% over RT alone
- 5y OS benefit for   RT -> aC: 2% over RT alone

| addition of          | OS HR | 5y   | 10y  |
| -------------------- | ----- | ---- | ---- |
| any chemo            | 0.79  | 6.1  | 8.4  |
| induction chemo      | 0.99  | 2    | -1.4 |
| induction/concurrent | 0.73  | 6    | 9.6  | 
| concurrent chemo     | 0.81  | 5.2  | 7.2  |
| concurrent/adjuvant  | 0.68  | 12.3 | 13.9 |

|                      | <40y | 40-59y | 50-59y | >60y |
| -------------------- | ---- | ------ | ------ | ---- |
| HR addition of chemo | 0.6  | 0.72   | 0.79   | 0.89 |
| 5y OS increase       | 8.5  | 7.1    | 6.1    | 3.9     |

- DM
	- Addition of Induction chemo: HR 0.68
	- Addition of Adjuvant chemo: HR 0.76

# notes
- main benefit is from Concurrent chemo (as in [[INT0099 (RT v CCRT+AdjC)]])
	- Adjuvant and induction also add a benefit, but not as much
- best combo is concurrent + adjuvant chemo #txit 

>[!summary] 
> Can we summarize the benefit of chemo?
> - the MAC-NPC meta analysis looked at 26 trials with a total of 7000 patients. Basically any trial of non-metastatic disease which compared any combination of RT and chemo timings was eligible. 
> - They found that the best benefit was found with the addition of concurrent and adjuvant chemo (per [[INT0099 (RT v CCRT+AdjC)|INT0099]] & [[Chen (II, RT Â± concurrent)|Chen]]) with a HR of 0.68 and 14% OS benefit at 10y, though induction and concurrent was not far behind with a HR of 0.73 and a 10% OS benefit at 10y. 
> - they also found an age effect: the absolute OS benefit of chemo at 5y for patients younger than 40 was double that of those >60y
