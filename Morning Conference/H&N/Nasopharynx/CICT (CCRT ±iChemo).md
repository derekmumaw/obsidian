> {± GemCis q3w x3c} → CCRT with CDDP 100 q3w.

# Study
- 480 pts.
	- Stage III-IVB
	- NKSqCC (=EBV associated)
	- MFU 43m
- Treatment
	- Gemcitabine + CisP q3w x3c → CCRT (CisP 100 q3w x3c)
	- Very high compliance:
		- 97% completed 3c of induction chemo,
		- 92% received 2-3 cycles of concurrent.

# Results
| 3y     | CCRT | ==+ iChemo== |
| ------ | ---- | ------------ |
| RFS    | 77   | ==85==       |
| OS     | 90   | ==95==       |
| aG3+   | 55   | 75           |
| lG3/4  | 11   | 9            |
| **5y** |      |              |
| OS     | 79   | ==88==       |

- Both RFS and OS outcomes are likely driven by improvements in distant recurrence rates.
- Response to induction chemo was strongly associated with OS (100% in CR, 88% in PR, 62% if stable/PD).
- No difference in OS among those with low pre-treatment EBV (<4000 copies).

# Notes
- pay attention to Fig 2 which stratifies OS effect by EBV high v low (big effect of induction in EBV+, but small effect in EBV-)
- Gem/cis comes from here #txit

>[!summary]
> Is there any role for induction chemo?
> - The Chinese Induction Chemo Trial randomized 500 patients with advanced, EBVdisease to ChemoRT with or without 3c of induction GemCis.
> - The results favored induction with a 10% increase in 3y RFS and 5y OS. There was a 20% acute increase in G3+, but this normalized.
