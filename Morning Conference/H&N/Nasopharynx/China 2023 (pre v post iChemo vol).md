> **NAC→ Pre vs. Post-NAC volumes**.

# study
- 212 stage III-IVB NPC patients. The non-inferiority margin was set at 15%. MFU 8y.

# results
- 8y treatment failure or death in ~33→ 29%.
- No late G4 toxicity.
- 5y OS ~78→ 83%.
- 5y PFS ~72→ 78%
- 5y LR-RFS ~90→ 94%.
- 5y DMFS ~78→ 82%.
- Pre-IC group had higher incidence of xerostomia and hearing damage than the post-IC group.
- Post-IC group showed significant improvement in cognitive function and symptoms including dry mouth, sticky saliva, and feeling ill.

# notes
- RLD cites the [Wang] study #todo 
- again, careful because it's mostly EBV+
- all LF were in the high-dose region thus, you can probably treat just the post-chemo. 
- RLD is more conservative, just pulling back more aggressively in areas that will make an OAR/toxicity benefit
	- most of the NPx gets 70 Gy. 
	- make sure everything you are concerned about gets at least 60 Gy
- on boards: err on the side of larger volumes (i.e. don't shrink base on response to iChemo)
	- this is especially true for non-NPx H&N cancers

> Reducing target volumes of IMRT after NAC showed no inferiority in terms of risk of LRR and potentially improved QoL.
