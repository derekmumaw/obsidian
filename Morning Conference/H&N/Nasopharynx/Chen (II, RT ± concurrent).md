# study
- 236 pts. 
	- T1-2, N0-1 (**stage II**). 
	- 95% WHO III (EBV). 
	- MFU 60 mo.

- Treatment
	- RT: 68-70 Gy to primary tumor, 50 Gy to node negative neck.
		- 2D RT, no IMRT.
	- ± concurrent CisP (30mg/w)
		
# results
| 5y    | RT     | ==+ CisP== |
| ----- | ------ | ---------- |
| OS    | 86     | ==95==     |
| PFS   | 78     | ==88==     |
| DMFS  | 84     | ==95==     |
| LRC   | 92     | 92         |
| aG3/4 | ==40== | 64         |
| lG3/4 | 12     | 12         |

- MVA: # chemo cycles -> improved OS.

>[!summary] 
> In early stage disease, is RT alone sufficient? Or would it benefit from some concurrent chemo?
> - The Chen study randomized 236 patients with up to T2N1, mostly EBV+ disease to RT with or without concurrent CisP. 
> - The results pretty clearly favored adding conccurrent chemo with a 10% advantage in 5y OS, PFS, and DMFS. LRC was unchanged. There was a 25% increase in acute G3/4 toxicity, but late toxicity was equivalent.
> - Look at [[Tang (LR Deescalation)]] to see a rebuttal
