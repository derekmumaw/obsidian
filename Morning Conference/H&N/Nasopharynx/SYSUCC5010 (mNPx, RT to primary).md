> PF x3c with PR/CR→ Chemo {± RT to Primary}

# study
- 126 patients 
	- de novo mNPC. 
	- MFU: 2y.

# results

| 2y  | PR/CR to Chemo | + RT to primary |
| --- | -------------- | --------------- |
| OS  | 55             | 76              |
| LR  | 70             | 16              | 

- No difference in acute heme or GI AE.-
- In CMT arm, Acute G3+ dermatitis 8%, mucositis 34%, xerostomia 7%. Late G3+ SNHL 5% and trismus 3%.

# notes
- no RT to metastases
- huge OS benefit for consolidative chemoRT
-  some logistical problems with overlapping with prior palliative RT fields.

> TBL: The addition of aggressive locoregional radiation is now firmly established in the treatment paradigm for chemo-responsive metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma to drastically improve survival.
