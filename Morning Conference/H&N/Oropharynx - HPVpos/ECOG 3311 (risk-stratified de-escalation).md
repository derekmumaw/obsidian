# Study
- 495 patients 
	- s/p TORS
	- OP (Tonsillar 66%). 
	- N2a/b (77%). cT1-2 stage III/IV AJCC7 without matted neck nodes. 
	- MFU 3y.

## Risk Groups
### Low Risk (11%)
- T1-2, 0-1LN. No PNI/LVI
- **-> Observation**

### Intermediate Risk (57%)
- <1mm ECE, SM <3mm, 2-4 LNs, PNI, LVI
- **-> PORT {50/25} v {DAHANCA 60/30 @6fx/w}**

### High risk (37%)
- >1mm ECE, 5+ LNs, +SM
- **-> POCCRT (66/33 + CisP)**

# Results
### Low risk
- 2y PFS 97%
- Less toxicity with Observation

### Intermediate risk
- 2y PFS for 50 and 60 Gy was equivalent (~95%)
- G3+ 15 vs 25%

### High risk
- 2y PFS 91%
- G3+ 61% (much higher than historical 70Gy control)

# Notes
- LR: showed it was safe to observe with up to 1 positive LN
- IR-B: most suprising results (that they were good)
- IR-C: comes from an old trial based on hypoxic tumors needing 60 Gy
- HR: trimodality therapy, but still had worse PFS than [[HN002 (dose-reduced RT Â± CisP)]] and bad toxicity. 

>[!summary] 
> This stuff is complicated! Is there a nice framework for how to incorporate TORS, dose-descalation, and chemo? 
> - ECOG 3311 provides this. They took 500 patients status post TORS and stratified them based on ECE, margins, # of LNs, and PNI/LVI to Low, Intermediate, and High risk groups. Low risk was observed, Intermediate Risk got postop RT either to 50/25 or an accelerated 60/30, and High got postop CCRT. 
> - Results showed that TORS alone was fine for Low risk, and that the 50Gy IR group was promising. The high risk group had excessive toxicity with the addition of chemo.
