# Epi
- 35k cases/y, ~6k deaths, (1/2 of all H&N)
- M:F 3-4:1.
	- 1/50 for men
	- 1/200 for women
- Bimodal age: 30-35, 60-65
- Most common H&N cancer in the USA.
- The incidence of OP cancer has doubled in the past 30 years
	- due to rise in HPV
- HPV+
	- younger/healthier.
	- fewer classic RFs
	- immunosuppressed
	- more regional spread
	- better prognosis
- HPV-
	- older/less healthy
	- classic smoking/EtOH Risk factors
	- larger primary tumors
	- worse prognosis
	- #todo change to table. make a new section

# Risk Factors
- originally smoking, alcohol
- now 80% HPV positive
	- endemic in the United States!
	- high-risk sexual behavior
- age

# Anatomy

![[img_ECRO_OPx_anatomy.png]]

## Subsites
- ATP, Tonsil, PTP, Soft palate, posterior pharyngeal wall, BOT, vallecula, glossotonsillar sulcus #pimp
- Tonsillar fossa (around tonsil):
	- Palatoglossus (ATP), palatopharyngeus (PTP), glossotonsillar sulcus
- Epiglottis
	- lingular and laryngeal surfaces #pimp
	- extension to lingular surface -> upstage to T3 -> needs chemo
	- extension to laryngeal surface -> upstage to T4 -> much worse prognosis

## LN Spread
```mermaid
graph LR

OP --> 1(II-IV)
```
- Level II LN most common, skip mets < 1% in OP cancer.
- Oropharynx LN spread: **70%**
	- due to richlymphatic networks/channels.

# Histology
- SqCC (95%), NHL (10% tonsil, 2% BOT).
- Rare: Lymphoepithelioma, adenoid cystic, plasmacytoma, melanoma, SCC, mets.

## HPV Stuff
- More likely poorly differentiated/non-keratinizing and basaloid in appearance.
- Use p16 instead of HPV.
	- Discordance: 20% of HPVwill be p16+, while only 3% HPV+ will be p16- [[RTOG 0129 + RTOG 0522]]
	- P16+ is 97% sensitive for high-risk HPV+ #emph
- E6/p53, E7/Rb. E7 inactivates Rb --> upregulates p16.
- If HPV is positive, 90% will have ECE! Negative w 30-50% ECE. Small or no primary seen.
- HPV is less likely to have EGFR mutations. Don’t use cetuximab!
- Around 60% of HPV+ tumors are ER+, which is a good prognostic indicator
- P16 is IHC (cheap). HPV is ISH ($)
	- p16 is sensitive. HPV is specific.
- Mixed status perform … mixed

# Staging
## HPV-

![[img_ECRO-OPx_staging_-.png#invert]]

- most other H&N sites use this nodal staging
- T4a v b: resectable v unresectable #pimp

## HPV+

![[img_ECRO_OPx_staging_+.png#invert]]

- nodal staging is same as [[ECRO Nasopharynx]] #pimp
	- NPx also driven by virus (EBV)
- pN is just based on number of nodes

# Workup

## H&P
- Painless neck mass (most common).
- dysphagia, odynophagia, otalgia (CN9), trismus

## Exam
- Bimanual floor or mouth exam with attention to tongue mobility, trismus, neck (75% cN+).

### Laryngoscopy
- Assess extent of primary and look for second primary

## Labs
- CBC, BMP (renal function for CisP)

## Imaging
- CT neck with contrast
	- With laryngoscopy, better than PET for localization
- Consider MRI with contrast to help assess invasion,
- PET/CT if stage III/IV.

## Biopsy
- FNA of LAD acceptable,
- Recommend biopsy of primary via tonsillectomy/BOT biopsy
	- Even with a biopsy-proven neck node, still should biopsy suspected primary.
- HPV/p16 testing

## Dental Eval
- If they need extractions, do it pre-tx
- 50 Gy limit to mandible (ORN)
- consider fluoride trays prophylactically to prevent xerostomia complications

# Treatment
- trigger to use add chemo to RT #pimp
	- +SM, ENE, also multiple nodes
- T1-2, N0 -> TORS is preferred.
- T1-2 + single node <3cm -> definitive RT or TORS
	- hard to have just one node with nothing else suspicious
- Anything more advanced that that: definitive RT with/without chemo is SOC
- consider adding AVOID
