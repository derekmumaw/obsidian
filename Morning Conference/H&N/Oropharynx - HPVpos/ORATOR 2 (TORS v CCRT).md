> {TORS + LND (PRN PORT)} vs. {dose-reduced RT ± {CC}}

# study
- 61 recruited of 140 original goal
	- accrual halted because of excessive toxicity in the TORS and LND arm
	- OPx
	- T2- N2-
	- HPV+
	- SM+ (8%). Bilateral ND (44%). Temporary trach (65%)
	- PORT (78%)
	- 2018-2020
	- MFU 17 mo

## Treatment
- TORS+LND: (n=31)
	- PORT (66%): 50/25 or 60/30 Gy based on \*risk factors (no chemo!)
		- *\*ENE, SM < 3mm, > 1 LN positive (or > 3 cm), LVSI, pT3-4 disease.
		- LVSI alone is not a clear indication for ART. 
- Definitive RT: (n=30)
	- Dose reduced (3 levels)
		- 60/30 to GTV and involved nodes,
		- 54/30 to high risk subclinical areas,
		- 48/30 to low risk nodes.
	- Weekly CDDP if multiple nodes positive or single lymph node > 3 cm.

# results
| 2y  | Surgery | ==RT==  |
| --- | ------- | ------- |
| OS  | 89      | ==100== |
| PFS | 84      | ==100== |
| G2+ | 71      | ==67==  |
| G5  | 6.4%    | ==0%==  |
    
- There were three deaths, all in the TORS and LND arm
	- 2 treatment related deaths at 0.7 and 4.3 months after randomization
	- 1 hemorrhage and 1 cervical osteomyelitis
	- 1 myocardial infarction at 8.5 months. 
- G3-5 hemorrhage ~6% (same rate on E3311, ORATOR, and ORATOR2).

# notes
- see UF Parsons trial: Sx v RT for OPx
	- older trial (2000s)
	- Sx+PO(CC)RT v CCRT (Sx as salvage)
	- oncologic outcomes are the same, but fatal complications and toxicity lower with RT
	- AND, this was with larger surgeries and less conformal RT. (i.e. nowadays--with TORS and IMRT--this should skew even more in RT's favor) #emph  

>[!summary] 
> Given the (?promising?) results of the ORATOR trial, maybe we should run a larger trial?
> - ORATOR 2 tried to succeed where ORATOR failed but they only succeeded in making the point more emphatically. 
> - Patients were randomized to TORS+PORT for certain risk factors or definitive, dose-reduced RT up to 60Gy. 
> - They were only able to randomize 61 patients before the trial stopped after they found 3 deaths in the TORS arm with 2 directly attributable to the surgery.
> - Even with that limited set of patients, the definitive RT arm had better OS and PFS with reduced rates of G2+ toxicity. 
> - As a bonus, it also showed that dose-reduced RT performs well!
