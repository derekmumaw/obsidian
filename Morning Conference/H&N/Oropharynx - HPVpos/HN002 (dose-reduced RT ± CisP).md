>[!intervention]
> Dose-reduced RT to 60-54-48/30 ± {CDDP}.

# Study
- 306 pts.
	- p16+
	- OPx,
	- ≤ 10py,
	- not T4 or N3 and no T1-2N0
		- (43% of [[RTOG 1016 (RT + (cetux v CisP))|RTOG 1016]] eligible).
		- T2-3 (60%). N2 (75%).
	- MFU 2.6y.

## Treatment
- {60 Gy in 6 weeks + CisP qW} vs. {60 Gy in 5 weeks (no chemo)}
- Unilateral allowed if:
	- cT1-3 tonsil, < 1 cm SP without BOT invasion up to N2a, some N2b if level II confined.
- Bilateral IMRT (80%)

# Notes
- HN005 closed early and didn't reach non-inferiority

>[!summary]
> Do we need chemo if we are dose-reducing?
> - HN002 tested this hypothesis with 300 patients. They were randomized to either an accelerated [DAHANCA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26255764)-style 60Gy in 5 weeks course of RT or standard fractionation but with weekly CisP.
> - The results favored the addition of CisP with a 7% reduction in LRF translating to a hint at improved PFS but this was just a non-inferiority trial.
> - This prompted HN005 which is currently accruing to test 70Gy+CisP to 60Gy+CisP|Nivo
