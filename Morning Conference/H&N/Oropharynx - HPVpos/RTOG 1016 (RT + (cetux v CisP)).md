# study
- 849 pts.
	- P16+
	- everyone except T1-2N1 and M1
- Treatment
	- 70 Gy/35 @6 fx/w (**accelerated**)
		- 50-52.5/35 "low risk" elective neck volume.
	- Cetux 400 loading/250 q1w x7c vs. CDDP 100 q3w x2c.Â

>[!summary] 
> What is the best concurrent chemo for HPV+ disease?
> - RTOG 1016 was a noninferiority trial which compared Cetuximab and CisP. They randomized 850 patients with HPV+ disease to these two regimens.
> - There's a reason we don't often see Cetuximab: Cetuximab wasn't better than CiP; in fact, it wasn't even non-inferior. It had worse control rates which translated to a survival detriment and it carried a substantially higher rate of feeding tube requirement.
