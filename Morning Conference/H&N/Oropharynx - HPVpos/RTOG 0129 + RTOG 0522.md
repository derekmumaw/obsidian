> Pooled analysis [Fakhry JCO '14]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4195851/) of 01-29 and 05-22

# Study

## 0129
- 433 pts
	- stage III-IV
	- OPx, HPx, LX, _OC_
- intervention
	- {AFX-ccboost: (72/42)} v {SFX: (70/35)} + CisP
- results
	- Slightly favors AFX group (only a trend)
	- smoking decreased 5y-OS by 25%

## 0522
- 625 patients
	- stage III-IV
	- OPx, HPx, LX, _OC_
- intervention
	- AFX-ccboost: (70/35 @6fx/w) + cisP Â± {cetux}
- results
	- Cetux had more toxicity, no benefit

## Combined
- 181 patients (105+, 76-)
	- progression after CCRT on 0129 (n=95) or 0522 (n=86)

# Results
![[img_RTOG_0129,0522_results.png#invert]]

| 2y                 | +    | -    |
| ------------------ | ---- | ---- |
| med. time to prog. | 8.2  | 7.3  |
| regional prog.     | 31   | 18   |
| logal prog.        | 20   | 33   |
| OS                 | 55   | 28   |
| medOS              | 2.6y | 0.8y |

- HR for risk of death with HPV+: 0.48
- 2y-DM rate high (40%) in both groups

# Notes
- 0129 risk groups
- ![[img_RTOG0129_riskgroups.png#invert]] #emph
- smoking on-Tx decreases 5y-OS by 25% #txit
- 3y OS difference with HPV status: 25% #txit
- increased risk of 2nd primary in HPV-groups

>[!summary]
> What effect does HPV status have on OPx cancer?
> - RTOG 0129 and 0522 were two trials run in the early 00s that both incidentally studied HPV status. Their primary randomizations both produced really underwhelming results but the HPV was found to have a dramatic effect.
> - A combined analysis was done with the 180 patients from those trials who had HPV data and had progression.
> - Results showed that 2yOS was doubled and median OS was tripled in HPV+ patients. It also showed the classic association that HPV tends to have more regional progression while HPVtends to have more local progression.
