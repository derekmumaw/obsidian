> Re-evaluation of Ipsilateral Radiation for T1-T2N0-N2b Tonsil Carcinoma at the Princess Margaret Hospital in the Human Papillomavirus Era, 25 Years Later. [O'Sullivan](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.01.018). Retrospective Review

# study
- 379 patients 
	- Princess Margaret
	- T1-2N0-2b
	- Tonsillar cancer
		- well-laterlized: lateral 1/3 BOT/soft palate with <1cm extension
	- mfu: 5y

# results
- HPV+: ipsi vs bl RT: equivalent OS, LC, RC, and tox
- HPV-: ipsi vs bl RT: equivalent OS, LC, RC, and tox
- HPV+ v -: equivalent OS, LC, RC, and tox. 
- Contralateral nec failure rates at 5y was like 2%

# notes
- provides a good rule to do only unilateral treatment
	- 1/3rd rule above
	- you should also consider 'backflow' hypothesis with high nodal burden
- done in the 2000s when we used wedged pairs with much greater unintentional contralateral level II dose 
- Are contralateral failures fatal? No (see Lynch UK: "Multiple cervical lymph node involvement and extra-capsular extension")
	- especially table 2 showing that they can be salvaged successfully without survival detriment
- compare to [[D'Cruz (elective vs therapeutic ND)]] in OC where it is not ok to watch the neck
- compare to [[Taku MDACC (ipsi. neck RT)]]

>[!summary] 
> Given the differences in patterns of failure seen in 0129 and 0522, do we need to change our RT fields?
> - O'Sullivan at Princess Margaret reviewed nearly 400 of their well-lateralized tonsil cancer patients. 
> - They found basically no difference in OS, LC, RC, or tox rates regardless of whether they got ipsilateral or bilateral RT or if they were HPV+ or -.
