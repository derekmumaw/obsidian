# study
- 68 pts.
	- T1-2 N0-2 ≤ 4 cm, no radiographic ECE.
		- N2 51%. N1 18%. T2 56%.
	- p16+ (88%).
	- BOT 25%. SM+ 12%. 
	- 2012-2017.
	- MFU 45 mo.
- Treatment
	- PORT (70%):
		- 60-54/30 if T3/4, N+, LVSI, SM < 2 mm.
		- CCRT to 64/30 if SM+ or ECE. 
	- Primary RT:
		- (70-63-54)/35 (RLD style!)
		- CDDP 100 q3w added for N+ disease.

# results
| 1y                                   | TORS+PORT | Def. CCRT |
| ------------------------------------ | --------- | --------- |
| Dysphagia score  <br>(higher=better) | 80        | 86        |
| Unrestricted diet                    | 84        | 100       |

- Favoring RT: 
	- Better swallowing, pain,  no bleeding, less trismus, trend towards less shoulder impairment. Less need for nutritional supplements at 3 years.
- Favoring surgery:
	- Less tinnitus/hearing loss, less dry mouth, less neutropenia, less constipation.
- When excluding TORS patients who received adjuvant RT, surgery still had worse MDADI than RT alone (site specific: no difference with RT alone vs. TORS alone for tonsil or tonsillar fossa tumors, but RT alone appears to have superior MDADI for BOT).

# notes
- Shows that there's no group where surgery is *better* than RT. 

>[!summary] 
> With recent advances in technology, maybe we can *cut* out RT with TORS and spare patients the awful RT side effects?
> - The ORATOR trial tested this theory by randomizing 70 patients with early stage disease up to T2N2 HPV+ disease to TORS+PORT or definitive RT. 
> - The results showed that overall QOL is basically the same and maybe slightly favors RT. It's a case of pick your poison. 
> - The point could be made that 70% of the TORS patients got PORT and so maybe that was driving the toxicity, but they looked at that 30% who didn't and they found the same lack of benefit.
