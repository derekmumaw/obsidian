# Study

## RTOG 9501
- 416 pts.
	- OC, OP (42%), larynx, HPX.
	- 2+ LN, ENE or SM+ (18%).
- Treatment
	- 60-66 Gy in 30-33 fractions (6 Gy optional boost)
		- 13% of patients received 66 Gy.
	- {± CDDP 100 d1, 22, 43 (q3w x3c)}

## EORTC 22931
- 334 pts.
	- OC, OP (30%), HPX, LX.
	- stage III-IV
	- pT3/4 Nx (except T3N0 larynx).
	- SM if pT1/2 pN2/3.
	- Lower stage with PNI, ENE, SM+ (28%), or vascular tumor embolism eligible.
	- OC/OP with level IV or V LN.
	- MFU 60 mo.
- Treatment
	- 66 Gy to primary, 54 Gy to low risk volumes
		- 91% of patients received 66 Gy
	- {± CDDP 100 d1, 22, 43 (q3w x3c)}

## Differences
![[img_RTOG 9501, EORTC 22931 (PORT  CC)_inclusion.png#invert]]
- EORTC with broader inclusion criteria (vascular tumor embolism, PNI, etc.)
- EORTC with more positive margins
- EORTC with lower nodal burden
- EORTC had higher doses (most got 66, not 60)

# Results
## RTOG 9501
- 3y LRC 67→ 78%, - 3y OS ~47→ 56%. 3y DM ~20%.
	- ECE and/or SM+:
		- 10y DFS 12→ 18%, 10y LRC 21→ 33%. 10y OS ~20→ 27% (p=0.07)

## EORTC 22931
- 5y LRC 69→ 82%, 5y DFS 36→ 47%. 5y OS 40→ 53%. 5y DM ~23%.

## Combined
![[img_RTOG 9501, EORTC 22931 (PORT  CC)_OS.png#invert]]
- 28% improvement in OS with POCCRT
	- not significant when ECE or +SM not present
- 42% improvement in LRC with POCCRT
- IR features: N+ without ECE, PNI, close margins.

>[!summary]
> When should you add chemo to PORT? RTOG 951 and EORTC 22931 both asked these questions in slightly different ways but got similar answers. 
> - a combined analysis helped clarify things. In all, there were 850 patients. 
> - The results showed that there was a 42% improvement in LRC with the addition of concurrent chemo which translated to a 28% improvement in OS. Importantly, however, this seemed to be driven mostly by the patients with either +SM or ENE and so these are the strongest indications for POCCRT. 
> - The other indications--close margins, pT4, pN2/3, PNI, vascular invasion, and LVSI--remain relative indications
