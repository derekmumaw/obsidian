> Retrospective review of Ipsilateral neck RT

# study
- 403 patients 
	- definitively or postop. 
		- Postoperative (52%). 
	- Mostly HPV+. 
	- Concurrent chemo (33%). 
	- N+ (85%). N2a (14%). N2b (45%). 
	- MFU 5.8y.
- Treatment
	- Ipsilateral treatment if well-lateralized:
		- tonsillar fossa, <=1cm extension to soft palate, no BOT involvement, T2-, cN2b-.
	- Target volume: Primary tumor +
		- ipsi II-IV/VII when N0, 
		- add Ib when N+.

# results
- 6y neck failure 3%, 
	- ipsilateral 1%
	- contralateral 2%
		- with N2b: 3%.
- 5y LC 97%

> see [[O'Sullivan (IpsiRT)]] for a comparison of ipsilateral and bilateral treatment (no difference)
> Do we need to treat bilaterally? 
> - Taku at MDACC answered this question with a retrospective review of 400 patients with well-lateralized tonsil disease
> - They had excellent regional control with only 1% ipsilateral neck failures and 2% contralateral neck failures.
