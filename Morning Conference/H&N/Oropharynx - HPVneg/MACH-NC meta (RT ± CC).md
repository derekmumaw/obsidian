>[!intervention] 
> **Local treatment  Chemotherapy**.

# study
- 101 trials, 18,951 pts
	- Stage III-IV in 90%.
	- 1965-2016 

# results
- 5y OS benefit 6.5%, 10y OS benefit 3.6%
- efficacy inversely proportional to age
- no OS benefit to induction or adjuvant (only concurrent)
	- DM most improved with induction improves DM

>[!summary] 
> What is the benefit of chemo when added to definitive RT? 
> - The MACH-MC meta-analysis looked at over 100 studies with nearly 20k patients and found a 6.5% 5y OS and 3.5% 10y OS benefit for concurrent chemo but no benefits to induction or adjuvant therapy. 
> - Caveat: Many older trials (1965) and outdated RT techniques, no p16 OP data, no robust toxicity data.
