> ChemoRT -> {Planned neck dissection} vs. {PET at 3m post-treatment}

# Study
- 564 pts
	- N2-3 H&N SCC
	- PR or equivocal response underwent neck dissection 4w after PET/CT
	- MFU 3y

# Results

| 2y  | LND   | PET |
| --- | ----- | --- |
| OS  | 82    | 85  |
| LRC | 90-95 | 92  |

- global QOL better with PET at 6m, equivalent at 2y
- $2000 saved with PET strategy
- Surgical complications ~40%.

>[!summary]
> What's the optimal follow up after ChemoRT?
> - PET at 3 months. A UK study randomized 560 patients with N2/3 disease to a planned neck dissection or a PET at 3 months after their chemoRT.
> - the results showed no differences in LRC or OS but initially slightly better QOL and a $2000 savings with the PET strategy
> - very similar conclusions to the [[Liauw (Â± Adjuvant. neck dissection)]] UF H&N study
