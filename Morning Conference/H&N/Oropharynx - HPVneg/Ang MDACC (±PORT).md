# Study
- 213 pts.
	- Locally advanced OC, OP or LX.
	- MFU 59 mo
	- RF:
		- 1 node group, ≥2 nodes, >3 cm node
		- micro SM, PNI, ECE
		- OC site
- Treatment

| Risk | Risk factors | Intervention                               |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| LR   | no RF        | No PORT                                    |
| IR   | 1 RF, no ECE | 57.6/32                                    |
| HR   | 2 RF or ECE  | 63/35 in 7w vs. 5w with concomitant  boost |

# Results
## Treatment time

| 5y  | <11w | 11-13w | >13w |
| --- | ---- | ------ | ---- |
| LRC | 76   | 62     | 38   |

## Risk Status

| 5y  | LR  | IR  | HR  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LRC | 90  | 94  | 68  |
| OS  | 83  | 66  | 42  |

- Trend for improved OS with a concomitant boost in the high-risk group (Fig 3, p=0.08).


>[!summary]
> What is the role for PORT?
> - MDACC asked this question several times ([[Peters MDACC (±PORT)]]) with Ang offering a nice risk stratified approach. They took 213 patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer and treated them as low, intermediate, or high risk depending on number and size of lymph nodes, surgical margin status, ECE, PNI, and site of origin. 
> - Low risk patients with no risk factors were observed. IR patients with 1 risk factor got 57.6 in 32. HR patients with 2 risk factors were randomized to 63/35 in 7 weeks or compressed into 5. 
> - the results showed that the IR group had better LRC than even the LR and so, nowadays, all locally-advanced gets PORT and it's more of a question of dose and addition of chemo.
