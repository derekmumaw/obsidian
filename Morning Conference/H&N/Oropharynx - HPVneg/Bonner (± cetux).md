# study
- 424 pts. 
	- III-IVB. 
	- 1999-2002. 
	- MFU 5y.
- Treatment
	- RT: lots of different regimens allowed
		- SFX 70/35. 
		- HFX 72-76.8 at 1.2 BID. 
		- AFX-C 54/30 w/ BID PM 1.5 for last 12fx (18 Gy - 72 Gy total)
	- Chemo: ± Cetux 400 loading, 250 q1w.

| results | RT  | + Cetuximab |
| ------- | --- | ----------- |
| MS      | 29  | 49          |
| 5y OS   | 36  | 46          | 

- MS for Cetuximab patients ± prominent acneiform rash of 26→ 69 mo (HR 0.49).
- Favorable features on analysis: OP, EGFR > 50%, HFX, AFX-C, Node positive, age < 65y.

>[!summary] 
> In SCC malignancies, EGFR may be a driving mutation and so what if we had an agent that could directly target that? We do: Cetuximab. But does it work?
> - Yes it does! At least according to Bonner. They randomized 425 patients to RT with or without cetuximab.
> - The results showed a 10% OS advantage to cetuximab at 5y and a near-doubling of the MS.
> - The big caveat here is that we know in HPV+ disease, it isn't as good as Cisplatin ([[RTOG 1016 (RT + (cetux v CisP))]])
> - It tends to be fairly toxic and so it leads to a lot of interruptions (which makes it less attractive than CisP)
