> Meta-analysis of dose-escalation

# Study
- 18 studies
- up to 85.9@2.6

# Results
## Oncologic
- 3y LRC: 68-86%
- 3y OS: 48-52%

## Toxicity
- no clear trends in acute or late
- ![[img_Australian meta (dose-escalation)_results_tox.png#invert]]

# notes
- lots of image guidance
	- with it, there was no association with G3 Mucositis rates 
	- opens door for possible dose-escalation (like to the hypoxic center)
- [Artscann III](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33052757/): pIII RCT. 
	- Cetux v CisP and dose-escalation 68 v 73Gy

>[!summary]
> What is the role for dose-escalation?
> - There was a meta-analysis by the Australians done in 2019 which included 17 or 18 studies.
> - The results showed large ranges in LRC and OS as well as toxicity so it's possible you can have excellent results, but I wouldn't feel comfortable doing this off of a clinical trial just yet.
