# study
- 261 pts 
	- stage III-IVB (UICC 7th ed). 
	- R1 (35%; "microscopically positive margins" included those with margins < 5 mm) and/or ENE (85%). 
	- OC (46%). HPX (31%). 
	- MFU 2.2y.

>[!summary] 
> what chemo regimen should we use?
> - JCOG 1008 asked whether the classic 100mg/m2 every 3 weeks was actually the best dosing or if maybe 40 mq Qweekly was better. They randomized 260 patients to these two regimens.
> - They found that, numerically, the OS and RFS were definitely non-inferior and looked to be actually improved with the weekly regimen despite a lower treatment completion rate. 
> - There also was improvement in nearly every toxicity measurement (except G5)
