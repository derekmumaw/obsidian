>[!intervention] 
> Altered fractionation (**HFX**, AFX, AFX-DR) **vs. SFX**.

# study
- 11,969 pts from 34 trials. 
	- hyperFX, moderately acceleratedFX, and very acceleratedFX.

# results
- 5y LRC benefit
	- AFX: 7%
		- HFX: 9% 
- 10y OS benefit
	- AFX: 1%
		- HFX: 4%
- v. CCsfxRT: 10y OS benefit
	- AFX: -5%

>[!summary] 
> There is a lot of RadBio justification for doing altered fractionation showing an improved therapeutic ratio, but how does it do in practices?
> It's not that big of a gain. The MARCH-HN meta analysis looked 34 trials with 12k patients undergoing all types of altered fractionation and, even with the best performer (hyperfractionation) found a modest bump in LRC of < 10% which translates to only a 4% OS benefit at 10y. 
> This gain is more than offset by the benefit that chemo adds so it's not worthwhile to change our current practices.
