# Study
- 264 pts 
	- H&N SqCC 
	- (90% III/IV). 
- Treatment
	- Strat: T/N stage, SM, PNI, # nodes/nodal groups/size/ECE, direct invasion.
	- ![[img_Peters MDACC (PORT)_schema.png#invert]]
	- LR: PORT 52.2-57.6/29-31 vs. 63/35.
	- HR: PORT 63/35 vs. 68.4/38.

# Results
- LR
	- 2y LC for ± 54 Gy of 63 → ==90%==.
- HR
	- No benefit for escalating above 63 Gy in HR (see [[Australian meta]])
- ECE: Most influential RF: 
	- 2y regional control for 52 → 63-68.4 Gy of 52→ 73%.
- MVA for LRC: 
	- SM- (HR 0.4)
	- white (HR 0.4) 
	- no ECE (HR 0.4)
	- package time ≥ 85d (12 weeks - HR 0.5)
- MVA for OS: 
	- Age ≥ 57y (HR 0.5)
	- SM+ (HR 0.5) 
	- ECE (HR 0.9)
	- package time ≥ 85d (HR 0.7)

>[!summary]
> See [[Ang MDACC (±PORT)]] for a companion on how to approach PORT
> - Peters also tried to establish a  risk stratified approach where 260 patients were treated at 3 postop levels 57.6, 63, and 68.4 based on T/N stage, SM status, PNI, ECE, and number/location/size of nodes. 
> - They found that 57.6 was the minimum dose and that risk factors of positive surgical margins and ECE were the strongest risk factors associated with LRC and OS and so they should be treated more aggressively with higher doses in POR.
