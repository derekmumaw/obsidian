>  PE -> CT/MRI (Â±PET) -> panendo/biopsies -> tonsillectomy

# Study
- 130 patients 
	- SCC metastases to cLNs from unknown site
	- All had PE, CT, MRI, panendoscopies, biopsies.
		- A fifth had PET.
		- A quarter had tonsillectomy

# Results
- Primary found in 45%
	- More likely if PE or radiography was positive
	- 85% were OPx (BOT, tonsils)
	- PET positive in 85%, primary found in 35%
	- Tonsillectomy was diagnostic in 35%

> How should we workup unknown primaries?
> - Mendenhall at UF provides a nice framework here. They reviewed 130 patients who all had a physical exam, CT, MRI, panendoscopy, and biopsies. 
> - 45% of cases were found to have a primary.
> - Optimal sequence seems to be PE -> rads -> panendo/bx -> tonsillectomy.
