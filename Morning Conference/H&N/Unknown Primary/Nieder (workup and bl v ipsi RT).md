# Study
- Systematic review of literature up to 2000

# Results
- Diagnostic Results
	- PET
		- Accuracy of 70%. PPV 55%. NPV 85% 
			- consistent with [[DAHANCA subset (value of PET)#Results]]
		- If PE, CT, MRI negative: PET found 5-25% primaries vs 25% with ipsilateral tonsillectomy
	- Panendo + biopsies
		- "encouraging"
- RT results

|Treatment|Bilateral|Unilateral|
|---|---|---|
|Mucosal recurrence|9 (2-13)|8 (5-44)|
|Nodal relapse|19 (8-45)|52 (31-63)|
|5y OS|50 (34-63)|37 (31-63)|

- - _No significance_

>[!summary]
> Should we be doing bilateral treatment?
>- Nieder performed a systematic review at the turn of the century which looked at some critical questions in the workup and management of CUP. 
>- He agreed with the [[DAHANCA subset (value of PET)|DAHANCA]] study that PETs are valuable, especially if PE, CT, and MRI are negative (a la [[Mendenhall (workup algorithm)]])
>- regarding ipsilateral vs bilateral treatment, numerically, the bilateral treatment was more effective with nodal relapse rates cut in half and a 15% increase in 5y OS, but it wasn't statistically significant.
