>  addition of PET to standard workup (PE, CT, MRI, panendo, biopsies)

# Study
- 67 patients
	- cLN+ unknown primary

# Results
- PET+ -> 30% overall detection rate (but positive in 50%)
- 25% rate in change of therapy
- PET prior to biopsies reduces false positives 
	- pre: 13%, post 50%

| metric | %   |
| ------ | --- |
| Sn     | 86  | 
| Sp     | 69  |
| PPV    | 60  |
| NPV    | 90  |

>[!summary]
> The [[Mendenhall (workup algorithm)]] was inconclusive regarding the role for PET. What value does it add?
> - The Danes did a prospective study of this where 67 patients with CUP had a PET performed in the workup. 
> - The PET was the sole diagnostic clue in 30% and lead to a change in management in 25% of patients. This gives a PPV of 60% and a NPV of 90%
> - If you do a PET, it should be done prior to biopsy as it cuts the false positive rate to 13% from 50%
