# Epidemiology
- ~3% of all H&N cancers
- Median age 50-70
- M:F 4:1

# Risk Factors
## General (basically oropharynx/oral Cavity RFs)

# Location of Primary

|           site | percentage |
| --------------:| ---------- |
|         Tonsil | 45%        |
|            BOT | 40%        |
| pyriform sinus | 10%        |

- ~50% will find primary
	- 50% found by DL or site-directed biopsy.
		- DL detects 40% of cases.
		- much better if guided by PET/CT/MRI (25% success if blind)
	- 25% are found by tonsillectomy.
		- Bilateral tonsillectomy identifies contra tonsillar primary in 5-10%.
		- Detection rate: tonsillar bx 3%, tonsillectomy 30%
	- 25% are found by PET/CT:
		- PPV ~90% and NPV ~75%

# Staging
![[img_ECRO Unknown Primary_staging.png#invert]]

# Workup
## History
- Presentation: painless neck mass in Level II (50%), dysphagia, odynophagia, otalgia.
- N1 in 25% at presentation
- Benign DDX: branchial cleft cyst
- any history of neck history #pimp
	- disrupts lymphatics

## Exam
- Attention to tongue mobility, FOM, trismus, neck, thorough skin exam.

## Labs
- CBC, CMP,
- HPV, EBV
	- P16+, HPV- -> skin primary?
	- not necessary, but may help define field borders
- TG, calcitonin and PAX8 (for thyroid)
- TTF (for adenocarcinoma)

## Imaging
- CT H&N w contrast, PET/CT (10% have DM).
- If PET(-), -> EUA with directed bx of NPX, tonsils, BOT, pyriform. Consider tonsillectomy (see [[Mendenhall (workup algorithm)]])
	- without PET, EUA diagnostic yield only 15-30%
	- PET has high false positive rate (15-20%)
- If cystic appearance of LN, think HPV+
- PET after RT to help determine if neck dissection should occur should wait at least 3 mo after RT

## Biopsy/intervention
- prefer FNA (core can seed track)
	- only advantage to the core is for lymphoma
	- Do not do excisional/incisional bx (neck violation), unless neck dissection is forgone conclusion.
- Panendo
	- Don't blind biopsy ([Tanzler 2015] from UF)
		- Blind biopsy of tonsils (30%) and BOT (20%) may yield something
			- 6% bilateral tonsil involvement (higher than expected)
		- Blind biopsies of NPx and pyriform sinus are worthless (0%)
- Tonsillectomy ± lingual tonsillectomy
	- if everything else is negative
	- probably only should do ipsilateral (based on OPx data)
	- preferably via TORS ([[UK TORS (meta analysis)]])
	- tonsil biopsy not sufficient (need a tonsillectomy)

# Treatment
- If neck dissection alone:
	- ~50% fail at primary
	- ~15% fail in the dissected neck (~60% if ECE)
	- ~40% fail in a node-negative neck if you only treat ipsilaterally (Loyola data).

# RLD
## NCCN
- seems to favor LND first (diagnostic/therepeutic)
	- N1: observe (or RT),
	- N2/3: PORT (or POCCRT),
	- ENE: POCCRT
- RLD disagrees: most cases would be treated sufficiently by RT alone, or would require it anyways

## Dosing
- 70 to Gross disease vs 50 Gy followed by resection
- ?? To elective nodes

## Margins
- CTV = GTV + 0.5cm

## Site Treatment
- Max dose to putative primary site is 66 (50-66) Gy
	- 50 Gy to high risk mucosa is probably too low
- Unilateral neck
	- Be careful
	- ASCO allows it with a single + LN (N1)
		- Based on study with only 14 patients

## Decision to Treat Algorithm
- see [[Galloway (overview, history)]]
- Treat as:
	- BOT (90%)
	- NPX (1%)
	- Skin (6%)
	- ? (3%)
	- All these patients could get a neck dissection and treat with RT based on those results (BOARDS-safe answer)
		- RLD disagrees with reflexive neck dissection
- Never treat Oral cavity
![[img_ECRO Unknown Primary_RLD-algo.png]]

### Unknown to Parotid
- Assume it came from the skin
- Parotidectomy +/- ND
- Primary RT is an option
	- Don't treat mucosal site, just ipsilateral neck
	- If no ND:  CTV = parotid, LII-V, Sclav
	- If yes ND: CTV = ^ or just the positive node levels on ND

### Unknown to 1b
- Assume oropharynx vs Oral cavity
- If workup negative, ND
	- If N1 and no ECE, no adj RT needed
	- If N2a+ or ECE, ipsilateral neck RT
		- If ECE+, concurrent chemoRT

### Unknown to II
- Assume BOT
	- Probably electively treat whole BOT (can consider ipsilateral BOT)
- Never electively treat larynx

## Treatment
### Unilateral
- true unilateral treatment now possible (good VMAT, protons). Some of the old data about unliteral vs bilateral doesn't necessarily still apply #emph
- [[ASCO Unknown Primary Guidelines]] says you can treat unilaterally with a single node
	- based on a study from WashU 2012 with only 14 patients

### Mucosa
- Should we treat the mucosa? NCCN says dealer's choice

### Treat as:
#### BOT
- Level IIA node
	- 66-70 to _ipsilateral_ BOT
	- 50 to ipsilateral RS, RP, V, Sclav, II-IV
	- NPx not included in target
- isolated III
	- treat like T1 BOT or LND -> RT if pN2b or ENE
#### NPX
- level IIB or V (if EBV suggests NPX)
	- NPx included in target: 66 to bilateral NPx
	- 50 to bilateral RS, RP, IB-V, Sclav
#### Skin
- level IIB or V (if EBV/history suggests skin)
	- do a neck dissection -> tailor RT to results
	- 50 to ipsilateral II-V, Sclav, ?parotid, ?RS
#### ?
- level I or IV
	- do a neck dissection -> tailor RT to results
