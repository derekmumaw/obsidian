> ? Use of 4-week post RT CT to guide need for neck dissection

# Study
- 550 pts
	- LN+ H&N cancer
	- all got 7440cGy
	- CT 30 days post-RT
	- radCR = no LN > 1.5cm or abnormal morphology
	- 60% with planned post-RT neck dissection
	- 1990-2002

# Results

| results      | NPV % |
| ------------ | ----- |
| Negative PE: | 77    |
| radCR:         | 94    |

- 32 patients with rCR got RT but no dissection
	- 5y control rate = 100%. CSS 72%.
	- Equivalent to those with negative neck dissection

# Notes

>[!summary]
> Do these patients need a post-RT neck dissection?
> - Liauw at UF did a review of 550 patients who had RT and underwent a CT 30 days later. 60% of those patients got a planned neck dissection.
> - The NPV of a physical exam was found to be 77 but the NPV of a CT (no abnormal morphology, no lymph node > 1.5cm) was an astonishing 94%.
> - 30 patients had a radiographic CR with no dissection and their 5y control rate was 100% with a CSS of 72%: equivalent to those who had surgery.
> - this is similar to the [[PET-NECK (PET v LND)]] results in OPx
