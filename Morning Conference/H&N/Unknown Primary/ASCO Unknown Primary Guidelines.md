>Maghami. ASCO. 2020. Guidelines

# Takeaways
## Workup
1. History, Physical exam (+laryngoscopy)
2. NA or Core biopsy should be performed
3. HPV should be done on II and III (EBV considered for HPV-nodes)
4. start imaging with CT+contrast
5. follow up negative CT with PET

## Surgical Diagnostic/Therepeutic Procedures
1. PanEndo with directed biopsies. No random biopsies.
2. if unilateral cN+: perform ipsilateral palatine tonsillectomy -> ipsilateral lingual tonsillectomy. Consider bilateral palatine tonsillectomy.
3. if bilateral cN+: unilateral lingual tonsillectomy on side with greatest nodal burden -> contralateral lingual tonsillectomy. Don't do bilateral palatine tonsillectomy after bilateral lingual tonsillectomy
4. if Frozen is positive, complete resection (transoral)
5. send to path (duh?)
6. make good use of frozen sections (duh?)

## Surgical Management of Neck
1. unilateral small-volume: Sx vs RT
2. bilateral small-volume: Sx(Â±PORT) vs (CC)RT
3. bilateral large-volume or ENE: CCRT
4. if doing LND: IIA, III, IV should always be included

## RT/Chemo
1. RT to gross and elective nodal Volumes
2. HPV+ should included putative primary site (ipsilateral tonsilar bed/soft palate, mucosa of BOT)
3. HPVshould get the same (though consider bilateral more strongly)
4. if most suspicious for cutaneous primary, avoid mucosal sites
5. if most suspicious for NPx, may treat NPx mucosa alone (+ LNs)
6. default is bilateral neck
7. consider unilateral only if single node, no ENE, no concern for NPx origin
8. N3, bilateral nodes, ENE require bilateral neck
9. 70Gy gross, 50Gy putative primary, 40-50Gy ENI
10. PORT fields dependent on extent of surgery and results
11. if no putatitve primary site identified -> PORT should include mucosal sites (see 2. and 3.)
