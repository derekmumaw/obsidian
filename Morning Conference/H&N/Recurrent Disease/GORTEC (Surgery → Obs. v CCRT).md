# Study
- 130 pts.
	- recurrences: 50% LR, 25% nodal, 33% new primary
	- Inclusion: deep infiltration (> 1 cm) or nodal recurrence.
		- Isolated nodal recurrences must have exceeded 3 cm,
		- larynx cancers must have included extralaryngeal spread on resection (rT4).
	- 6 month interval required between previous RT and surgery,
	- no gross residual disease was allowed.
	- Mostly SM+ or ECE.
- POCCRT to 60 Gy with concurrent 5-FU and HU, alternating weeks.
	- 60/30 over 11 weeks with a 9 day rest period between each week of radiation.

# Results
- LC and DFS HR 1.68 favoring POCCRT, no difference in OS. **2y OS ~45%**.
- 2y LRC around 20→ 60%.
- 2y DFS around 18→ 38%.
- Acute G3-4 mucositis in 28%.
- 2y late G3 / G4 toxicity of ~10→ 40% (p=0.06).

>[!summary]
> What about in the resectable population?
> - The french study meta-group of GETTEC and GORTEC tested salvage surgery followed by a randomization to either observation or POCCRT in 130 patients who had had prior RT. Re-RT was 60/30 with 5 days of treatment followed by 9 days of rest for 11 weeks.
> - The results favored re-RT with a tripling in LRC and a doubling of DFS. OS was nearly doubled from [[RTOG 9911 (unresectable → CCRT)|RTOG 9911]]
> - Toxicity remains a big problem (30% aG3/4)
