# Summary
## Patient Selection
1. Lots of discussion (tumor board)
2. if PFS and OS are expected to be <2y, spare surgery and high-dose re-RT. Focus on systemic therapy and palliative RT
3. use RPAs, nomograms

## Resectable Disease
1. if resectable with good functional outcomes → surgery
2. definitive RT only if patient refuses surgery
3. systemic therapy alone is not appropriate
4. POCCRT should be given (per [[GORTEC (Surgery → Obs. v CCRT)|GORTEC]])

## Unresectable Disease
1. 60-70 Gy with consideration for CC
2. no ENI
3. consider hyperfractionation (not mandatory)
4. _(see below)_
6. systemic therapy alone is _probably_ not appropriate

## SBRT
1. SBRT not SOC (but 35-44 Gy if you must)
2. may have a role for palliation?

## non-SCC re-RT
1. can extend SCC evidence to rationalize re-RT
2. lower threshold for palliative intent
