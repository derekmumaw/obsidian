# Study
- 90 patients
	- cT1-2N0M0 oropharyngeal cancer.
	- Primary endpoint: reduction of xerostomia at 6 mo () 99mTc salivary scintigraphy)
		- Severe salivary toxicity: post-tx salivary excretion fraction ratio < 45%.
	- MFU 43 mo.

# Results
| results  | EBRT boost | ==HDR boost== |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| 6m xero  | 44         | ==14==        |
| G2+ xero | 30         | ==7==         |
| 3y LC    | 56         | ==66==        |

- _* 3y LC only trend towards significance in PP analysis_

>[!summary]
> Brachytherapy works very well in some other disease sites. Maybe it would work in the H&N?
> - Tata Memorial tested replacing the final 20 Gy of high-dose boost with 21/7 of HDR brachytherapy in 90 patients with T1/2 OPx cancer.
> - The results strongly favored brachytherapy, at least from a toxicity reduction standpoint: xerostomia rates cut in third. LC did not suffer; in fact it was improved by 10% at 3y.
