> RPA validation for patient selection for re-irradiation using IMRT or SBRT

# Study
- 414 pts from 8 institutions.
	- Unresectable rSqCC.
	- MFU just over 2y.
- IMRT: 80% qday, 20% BID with 28% ENI.
- SBRT: qod, only 4% of patients had a small area of ENI.

# Results
- 2y OS for SBRT / IMRT of 16→ 35%
- MS for SBRT / IMRT of 8→ 13 mo
- 2y OS for RPA Class I / II / III of 62→ 40→ 17%
- Classes
	- **Class I: Resected, >2y**
		- 2y OS 62%
	- **Class II: Unresected or <2y**
		- 2y OS 40%
		- 2y OS for SBRT / IMRT of 19→ 39%.
		- For small tumors ≤ 25 cc or rT0-2, SBRT and IMRT seem equivalent for dose ≥ 35 Gy
	- **Class III: < 2y with organ dysfunction**
		- 2y OS 17%
			- Treatment: SBRT or observe. No patients who were RPA III ended up living.
- LRF when accounting for the competing risk of death for SBRT / IMRT of 57→ 45%.
- Acute G4+ for SBRT / IMRT of 0.5→ 5%, with equivalent late G3+ toxicity ~15%.

>[!summary]
> Does SBRT have any role in the recurrent setting?
> - another RPA from MIRI by Vargo looked at 414 unresectable patients treated with either IMRT or SBRT.
> - In general, IMRT was better. MS and 2y OS was basically doubled with IMRT and there was a 10% LRF benefit. Late G3+ toxicity was equivalent.
> - only for small tumors <25cc were SBRT and IMRT equivalent in Class II tumors treated to >35Gy SBRT.
