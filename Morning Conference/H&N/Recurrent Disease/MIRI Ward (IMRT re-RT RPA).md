# Study
- 412 pts.
	- First course 27% IMRT, 46% 3D
- rSqCC H&N to doses ≥ 40 Gy IMRT (median 66 Gy)
	- Half had surgery
	- Chemotherapy in 40%

# Results
## Oncologic
- OS at 2y / 5y of 40→ 22%
	- definitive v postop: 2y OS 35 → 45%
	- STR v GTR: 2y OS 33 → 50%
- LRF at 2y / 5y of 43→ 50%
	- definitive v postop: 2y LRF 46 → 40%
	- STR v GTR: 2y LRF 47 → 34%
- 2y DM 19%

## Toxicity
- Acute G3+: 20%
- 2y G3+: 14%
- Acute G4/5: 4.4 → 1.2%
- In total, 82% of pts experienced progression, death or severe late toxicity within 2 years

>[!summary]
> What about in the modern era with IMRT?
> - the Ward from the MIRI colloaborative published and RPA of 412 patients with IMRT re-RT.
> - The results showed that it was both more effective—OS was double [[RTOG 9911 (unresectable → CCRT)#Results|RTOG 9911]] in the definitive setting (though equivalent to [[GORTEC (Surgery → Obs. v CCRT)#Results|GORTEC]] postop)—and better tolerated with G3+ cut down from [[RTOG 9911 (unresectable → CCRT)|9911's]] 50% to 20% aG3 toxicity and aG4 cut in a quarter.
> - They also generated a prognostic RPA which considers time from first RT, resection status, and organ dysfunction
