> CCRT + Cis/Pac

# Study
- 105 pts.
	- Unresectable recurrence.
	- RT finished > 6 mo prior.
- RT:
	- 60 Gy in 1.5 Gy BID in four week on/week off cycles to 60 Gy.
	- 3D allowed.
	- Tumor + 2 cm.

# Results
- MS 12.1 mo. **2y OS 26%**.

| tox   | G3  | G4  | G5  | _G3+_ | _G4+_ |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | ----- | ----- |
| acute | 50  | 23  | 5   | 78    | 28    |
| late  | 17  | 17  | 4   | 37    | 21    |

- Overall G5 toxicity in 8%. Carotid blowout was seen.

> How should unresectable recurrences after RT be managed? Is Re-RT possible?
> - RTOG 9911 was an initial attempt at formalizing the management of recurrent H&N disease. They treated 105 patients with prior H&N disease treated with RT, now with an _unresectable_ recurrence.
> - They used 60 Gy in 1.5Gy BID fractions week-on/week-off.
> - Results weren't great. Toxicity was basically guaranteed with 80% with aG3+ and 30% aG4+. There was nearly 10% G5.
> - Despite this, oncologic outcomes weren't really all that good with MS of a year and only 25% OS at 2y
