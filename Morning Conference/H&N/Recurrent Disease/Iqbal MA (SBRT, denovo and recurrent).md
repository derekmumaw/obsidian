> A Systematic Review and Practical Considerations for SBRT in H&N Cancer** [Iqbal BJR '20](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32960652/):

> Systematic review

# Study
- Evaluated 26 studies, 5 in the primary setting and the remainder re-irradiation.
- Largest study of primary RT involved 66 patients delivered 30/5 to CTV and 40/5 to GTV, nearly half with concurrent chemo. One-third had IFF. Only 3% G3 toxicity.

# Results
- For Re-RT, Acute G3+ toxicities in 11% and late G3+ toxicity in 19%.
- Caution should be considered in cases of circumferential carotid artery involvement.
- Constraints for 5-fx Re-RT highlight difficulty delivering 30-40/5.
- Carotid Re-RT max 33 Gy.
- Larynx Re-RT 15 Gy mean.
- No CTV margins, PTV margins of 2-3 mm.
- See the Constraints section for more.

>[!summary]
> Based on [Ward](#7au1jxj9m6cs)]/[[Vargo](#ykpio6cx5va) MIRI and interpretation of the literature, patients ideally suited for SBRT are: Ideally >2y from treatment but certainly > 6 mo from previous treatment, resected tumor, or if unresected, functional with preserved organ.
Optimal PTV volume may be < 25 cc as per [Vargo](#ykpio6cx5va), while other studies report patients with smaller GTV ( â‰¤ 50 cc) may have significantly better survival.
