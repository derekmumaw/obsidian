# study
- 398 pts. 
	- T1-T2. 
		- Only 83 T2 (T2b = impaired VC mobility). 
- Median dose of 63 Gy.

# notes
- great correlation with T stage and control rates
- Most of the T2 detriment is coming from the impaired cord (consider adding chemo for T2 impaired cord)

>[!summary] 
> What factors predict for LF in early stage disease?
> - Dr. Le at UCSF ran a retrospective analysis of 400, mostly T1 patients. 
> - at 5y, results clearly showed that T stage was important: T1 did better than T2 by 15%, a freely mobile cord had doubled LC compared to an impaired cord, and subglottic extension had 20 worse LC. 
> - treatment considerations were also important: treatment times longer than 6 weeks dropped LC by 15 and 30% for T1 and T2 disease, hypofractionation more than doubled LC compared to hyperfractionation, and there was a 20% advantage to getting >65 Gy.
