# epidemiology
## LX
- 12,000 laryngeal cases per year. 
- 4000 deaths.
- Most common cancer of the head and neck (20% of all H&N).
- Glottic / Supraglottic / Subglottic rate of 69→ 30→ 1%.
- see [[RTOG 9111 ({RT} v {ICRT} v {CCRT})#results]] for highest-quality organ preservation rates

## HPX
- 2,500 hypopharyngeal cases per year (85% pyriform sinus).
- Generally a surgical disease. 
- Overall, 50% OS and 70% retain larynx = 35% alive w larynx.
- see [[Amdur (RT for early stage HPx)#results]] for stage-based survival
- see [[EORTC 24891 ({TL+PORT} v {IChemo+RT (HPx preservation})#results]] for organ preservation rates

# Risk factors
## LX 
- **tobacco**, alcohol, voice abuse, 
	- primarily heavy smoking population (not like p16+ OPx patients)
- Plummer-Vinson syndrome. #pimp
- Progression to cancer: 
	- Laryngeal leukoplakia estimated to progress 1-20% in 10 years, erythroplakia 30%.  

## HPX
 - smoking, alcohol, betel nut, nutritional deficiency (Vit C, Fe) 
 - iron deficiency associated with 70% of postcricoid cancers in northern European females
 - prior history of H&N cancers.

# Anatomy
## LX
| direction | border                         | 
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| Sup:      | hyoepiglottic ligament.        |
| Inf:      | cricoid.                       |
| Ant:      | Thyrohyoid membrane/cartilage. |
| Post:     | arytenoids.                    |

- Cervical levels: C3-C6
- Preepiglottic and paraglottic spaces are one continuous space anterosuperiorly. #pimp 
	- If preepiglotic space is invaded: T3 = Stage III -> Chemo #emph
	- often missed on Rads reads (bring up in TB)
- Laryngeal muscles (except cricothyroid) 
	- innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (CN X). 
	- invasion -> Fixed, midline cords.
- Cricothyroid 
	- innervated by SLN. 
	- invasion -> Mobile, "bowed" cords.
- Vallecula: 
	- space between the base of the tongue and epiglottis (part of BOT).
- Ventricle: 
	- fold of mucosa between true cords and false cords.
- Anterior commissure: #emph
	- Involvement precludes most surgeries (at least preservation surgeries)
	- Often underdosed #emph
	- should be (/\\) pointing anterior
- Posterior commissure
	- rare to see cancer here
- TVC: 
	- are at level of arytenoids (clue on axial imaging) #pimp 
- Subglottic extension is a bad prognostic sign #emph 

### subsites
#### Supraglottis (30%): 
- "A VISA": Arytenoids, Ventricular folds (FVC), Infra/Suprahyoid epiglottis, AEF.
- Nodal involvement (II-IV): T1-2 ~40%, T3-4 ~60%.
- 55% have uni nodal disease, while 16% have bilat nodal disease [Lindberg Cancer '72](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1097-0142%28197206%2929%3A6%3C1446%3A%3AAID-CNCR2820290604%3E3.0.CO%3B2-C).

#### Glottis (70%): 
- AC/PC, TVC and 5 mm below the margin of TVC. 
- RLD def: #emph lateral edge of ventricle to 5mm inferior to free edge of TVC
- Nodal involvement (uncommon): T1-2 < 5%, T3 15%, T4 30%.
- TVC layers: epithelium, basement membrane, sup layer of lamina propria (Reinke’s space), intermediate lamina propria, deep lamina propria, thyroarytenoid muscle. (Int lamina propria and the deep lamina propria form the vocal ligament) 

#### Subglottis (1%): 5 mm below true cords down to 1st tracheal ring.
- 25-50% present with nodal dz, commonly delphinean, lower jugular, pretracheal, upper mediastinum.
- If a tumor has subglottic extension, cover level 6 and consider upper mediastinum.
- Can be treated with CCRT, but salvage can be difficult.

### Lymphatic Drainage #emph
#### TVC 
- no lymphatic drainage
- no need to treat lymph nodes if T1
- But once it gets T2+, need to include lymph nodes
#### Supraglottic larynx
```mermaid

II --> III; 
III --> IV
```
#### Subglottic
```mermaid
graph LR

start(VI/Delphian) --> IV; 
```
- Bilateral neck 
	- Midline structure: always at risk (must treat) #emph 

## HPX 
- Borders: pharynx from hyoid (C3) to inf cricoid. 
- much higher nodal burden due to rich pharyngeal lymphatics #emph
	- treat much more generous volumes

### Subsites: “Three Ps” 
#### Piriform sinuses 85%
- very high nodal involvement (~75%), even for T1 (~60%).
- >80% present with stage III-IV disease, but only 2-4% w DM.
- Worst prognosis in H&N: ~25% develop DM in the first two years despite tx, highest in H&N.

#### Posterior pharyngeal wall
- extends laterally and forms the back of the piriform sinus #pimp 

#### Postcricoid area
- Postcricoid area: Mucosa underlying cricoid cartilage, with arytenoids mucosa superiorly and esophageal mucosa inferiorly. 
- Predominantly male for pyriform sinus and post pharynx, but predominantly female for postcricoid (5%).

# staging
## General principles
### T1
single region, normal cord
### T2
Adjacent region or impaired cord
### T3
paraglotic/epiglottic invasion/thyroid erosion or fixed cord
### T4a
invasion beyond larynx/through thyroid
### T4b
unresectable

# Pathology
- SqCC > 95%. 
	- Others include verrucous carcinoma (1-2%), AC, lymphoma, chondrosarcoma, melanoma, carcinoid tumor, adenoid cystic. 
	- CIS may occur in VC, but is rare in SGL.
- HPV: 
	- "HPV-status has been a game-changer for oropharyngeal cancer. This large meta-analysis indicates that the virus may also be a player in laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers where it again portends a better survival with hazard ratios for death of 0.7 and 0.6, respectively." [QS](http://www.quadshotnews.com/2020/10/going-viral.html) [Sahovaler JAMA HNS '20](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2771744)

# Workup
## History
- Focus on dysphagia, odynophagia, otalgia (nerve of Arnold), hoarseness, KPS, aspiration risk.

## Physical exam
- Laryngoscopy
	- most important part of the exam (CT doesn't show it well)
- Videostroboscopy can evaluate mucosal wave of true cords.

## Biopsy
- EUA + triple endoscopy with biopsy of the primary ± FNA of neck mass.
- Not easy to see subglottic extensions (may have to ask the surgeon to look) #emph 

## Imaging:
- Consider MRI with contrast to help assess invasion,
- PET/CT if stage III/IV.
- CT with high PPV for thyroid cartilage penetration (74%) and extralaryngeal spread (81%) [1](http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2009.24.7544).
- Audiology (treatment with CisP)

## Dental evaluation:
- if extractions are needed, better to do preRT #emph 
- 50Gy is hard limit for ORN (may start as low as 30 Gy) #pimp 
- also they're going to get xerostomia 2/2 treatment (increases dental problems)

# Treatment paradigm
- Early stage Glottic
	- [[Finland (Sx v RT)]] shows RT has better voice quality
	- Surgery (only if no AC involvement)
		- PORT for AEs on path
- T3, N1-
	- chemoRT
	- Surgery 
	- try induction chemo: if response -> RT. If no response -> TL
- T4a
	- Surgery preferred, but RT reasonable if functioning well. 
	- Don't forget about baseline Lx function. If it's not functioning, there's nothing to preserve (do Surgery)
- Tumor volume very important in LC
	- [[VA larynx ({TL,PORT} v {IChemo+RT (Lx preservation})|VA larynx]] shows increased salvage rates in T4
	- [UF: Mendenhall](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9196155/)
		- 8-9cc threshold for laryngectomy. 
		- (Glottic 6cc | supraglottic 12cc) -> laryngectomy
	- UofM
		- Bioselection: One cycle of chemotherapy (if response -> CCRT, if not -> Surgery) 
## RT
### primary RT
#### larynx only 2D
- 5x5cm. Consider wedge due to tapering of neck (but don't underdose AC)
- Sup: thyroid notch
- inf: inf of cricoid
- post: 1cm posterior to post edge of thyroid
- Ant: 1-2cm flash
#### larynx only IMRT
- concern that you're missing unintentional level II/III
- data says it's safe
