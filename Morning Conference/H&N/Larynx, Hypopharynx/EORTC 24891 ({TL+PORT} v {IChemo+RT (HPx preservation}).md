> {TL/PORT} vs. {CDDP/5-FU x3→ RT or surgery with PORT if < CR} (basically same as [[VA larynx ({TL,PORT} v {IChemo+RT (Lx preservation})|VA larynx]]).

# study
- 202 pts 
	- T2-4 pyriform sinus or AE tumors (HPX). 
- treatment
	- CDDP 100, 5-FU 1g for 5 days on d1, 22 ± 43 (3c). 
		- CR (54%) after 2c req before RT.  
	- PORT 50-64 Gy, Definitive RT 70 Gy.

# results
| response | T2  | T3  | T4  |
| -------- | --- | --- | --- |
| CR (54%) | 82  | 48  | 0    |

| 5y results      | TL/PORT | IC-RT |
| --------------- | ------- | ----- |
| DM              | 36      | ==25==    |
| LF              | 12      | 17    |
| RF              | 19      | 23    |
| OS              | 30      | 30    |

| **10y results** |         |       |
| OS              | 13      | 13    |
| OS+func.Lx      | --      | ==9==     |
- Around 2/3 of survivors retained their larynx.

# notes
- no difference in OS #txit

>[!summary] 
> How does the [[VA larynx ({TL,PORT} v {IChemo+RT (Lx preservation})|VA Larynx]] protocol work on the hypopharynx?
> - EORTC 24891 tested this on 202 patients with T2-4 disease. 
> - Oncologically, the results were underwhelming (similar to [[VA larynx ({TL,PORT} v {IChemo+RT (Lx preservation})#results|VA results]]) with dismal OS. 
> - **But** if you survived, there was a 2/3rds chance at keeping your larynx

> Improved LFS and response rate with docetaxel.
- 220 pts. 
	- Locally advanced larynx/hypopharynx requiring TL. 
- Treatment
	- paradigm
		- If CR/PR and normal larynx mobility→ 70 Gy RT. 
		- If no response→ Surgery + PORT to 54-66 Gy.
	- CCRT: Institutes discretion, cisplatin, carboplatin, and 5-ﬂuorouracil or two-drug combo.
- results
	- Compliance 67→ 82%. ORR 61→ 83%. CR 47→ 61%.
	- Response 59→ 80% (eligible for RT) and 10y larynx preservation 47→ 70%, 5y larynx preservation 58→ 74%.
	- 10y larynx dysfunction-free survival (LDFS) 37→ 64%, 5y LDFS 47→ 67%.
	- Equivalent 3y OS/PFS.
	- More neutropenia in the docetaxel arm. 
	- PEG 8%, trach 3%.
