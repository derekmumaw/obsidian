# study
-  180 pts.
	- T1 Glottic (80% T1a).
- Treatment
	- Bilateral parallel opposed fields.
	- Minimal cord involvement (≤ 2/3 of TVC involved): 60/30 vs. 56.25/25.
	- Substantial cord involvement (> 2/3 of TVC involved): 66/33 vs. 63/28.

^consistent with [[UCSF Le#fractionation]]

# notes
- where the hypofractionation comes from 
- [[UCSF Le]] extends this

>[!summary]
> How do we manage early-stage laryngeal disease?
> - Yamazaki would suggest we use a hypofractionated regimen at 2.25 Gy/fx. 
> - They randomized 180 patients with mostly T1a disease to either a standard regimen up to 66/33fx or a mildly hypofractionated arm up to 63/28.
> - The results showed a 15% increase in 5y LC from 77 to 92%, though this didn't translate to a survival benefit. It case at the price of a 20% increase in skin erythema.

## KROG 0201 [Moon RTO '14](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24161568/): 
- {66-70/33-35 (2 Gy)} vs. {63-67.5/28-30 (2.25 Gy)}.
- 156 patients. T1-2 glottic. MFU 5.5y.
- RT: T1: 66/33 vs. 63/28; T2: 70/35 vs. 67.5/30.
- 2y LPFS ~85→ 90%, 5y LPFS ~78→ 89% (p=0.213).
### conclusion
- very similar to [[Yamazaki (sFx v hFx)]] but more realistic control arm LC.

## NCDB [Bledsoe JNCI '17](https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/109/10/djx042/3611465): 
- 63-65.25 Gy (2.25 Gy) vs. 66-70 Gy (2 Gy)
- improved OS of the former.
### conclusion
- at NCDB scales, you get an OS benefit
