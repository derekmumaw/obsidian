# study
- 101 patients
	- T1-2, N0-3
	- Stage: I (6%), II (18%), III (20%), IVA (44%), IVB (12%)
- Treatment
	- RT alone: 
		- QD (56.5 - 75 Gy) or BID (59.6 - 79.2 Gy) (50-50%)
	- ± unilateral neck dissection for cN+

# results
- 5y LC T1: 89% -> 95% with salvage 
- 5y LC T2: 82% -> 91% with salvage 
- ±Apex involvement: 33% vs 100% 5y LC

| 5y  | I-II | III | IVA | IVB |
| --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| CSS | 96   | 62  | 49  | 33  |
| OS  | 60   | 41  | 29  | 25    |

# notes
- UF also has a size-based cutoff (like they do for Larynx)

>[!summary]
> How should early-stage Hypopharyngeal disease be treated? 
> - UF reported their results of RT alone for 101 patients with T1-2, up to N3 disease. 
> - They found that for Stage I-II disease, RT alone was an appropriate strategy. (anything more advanced probably requires surgery or adding chemo)
