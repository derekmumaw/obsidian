> T4 Laryngeal Cancer with Good Function: Should we be Reluctant to Treat Without Surgery? [Beitler IJROBP '18](https://www.redjournal.org/article/S0360-3016(18)30531-5/fulltext)

> "We wholeheartedly endorse the belief that patients with little prospect of regaining laryngeal function (whether because of a lack of support, compliance issues, or extensive destruction of the laryngeal framework) and those who are persistent smokers are poor candidates for laryngeal preservation. For such patients, laryngectomy is preferred."

- after [[VA larynx ({TL,PORT} v {IChemo+RT (Lx preservation})|VA]] and [[RTOG 9111 ({RT} v {ICRT} v {CCRT})|RTOG 9111]], larynx survival *declined*. But, more recently, they've begun to improve again. 
- see [[ASCO Guidelines--Larynx Preservation]] 2.2 and 4.1 which both recommend TL for large tumors or poor larynx function, but 'large' and 'poor function' don't perfectly correlate. 
- Really should be case-by-case decision

- Suggests the only real reason for surgery is patients with little prospect of regaining LX function and persistent smokers.
- Differences in DSS and OS between laryngeal preservation and total laryngectomy have narrowed in recent years.
