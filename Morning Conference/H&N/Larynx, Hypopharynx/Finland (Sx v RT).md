# study
- 56 patients
	- glottic T1a SqCC. 
	- Only men (primary outcome: comparison of voice quality)

# results
| results            | Sx  | RT  |
| ------------------ | --- | --- |
| *02y breathiness*  | 81  | 30  |
| 05y recurrences    | 16  | 16  |
| 05y OS             | 87  | 92  |
| 10y OS             | 20  | 20  |
| 05y DSS            | 97  | 100 |
| 05y RFS            | 81  | 88  |
| 5y Lx preservation | 97  | 92  |
- The primary treatment method was not associated with OS, RFS or DSS in a log-rank test.
- Overall perceptual voice quality was similar between treatment modalities 2y after treatment, but breathiness and hoarseness were more bothersome in the transoral laser surgery arm.

>[!summary] 
> How does surgery compare to RT for early stage glottic disease?
> - The Fins tested this question by randomizing 56 men with T1a disease. 
> - The primary outcome--voice quality--favored RT with rates of breathiness and hoarseness doubled in the surgery arm. Oncologic outcomes were also equivalent.
