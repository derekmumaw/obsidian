# study
- 332 pts.
	- Stage III/IV (not T1N1).
	- 63% SGL, 57% cord fixation. 
- treatment
	- PR or CR after 2c req before RT.  
	- Chemo
		- CDDP 100 q4w, 5-FU 1g for 5 days on d1, 22 ± 43.
	- RT
		- PORT: 50.4-74 Gy, 
		- Definitive: 66-76 Gy with 50-75 Gy to LNs.
- Response 
	- assessed by exam and indirect laryngoscopy 18-21d after C2: 
		- CR / PR / <PR of 31→ 54→ 15%. 
		- Less than PR after 2c of chemotherapy (15%) went straight to surgery.
	- 12w after completion of RT 
		- TL for PD in larynx or LND for nodes

# results

## larynx preservation: 2y = 64% 
| 2y              | TL  | iC RT |
| --------------- | --- | ----- |
| Lx Preservation | 12* | ==64==    |
| LR              | 2   | 12    |
| LRC             | 93  | 80    |
| OS              | 68  | 68    |
| DM              | 17  | 11    |
| alive           | 52  | 48    |
| alive + larynx  | 5   | ==31==      |
*\* 12% Lx preservation in TL arm = partial larrys*

## salvage
|               | ==<T4== | T4+ |
| ------------- | --- | --- |
| Salvage Larry | 29  | 56    |
- ∴ large volume T4 excluded from [[RTOG 9111 ({RT} v {ICRT} v {CCRT})#study]].
- Rate of salvage TL only ~25% for T2-3, but > 50% for T4!

## QOL
- CCRT improved long term QoL
	- Speech, coughing
	- smell/taste
	- freedom from pain, pain meds
	- social functioning
	- depression
- CCRT with worse dry mouth

# notes
- How did they determine Chemoradiation therapy? #pimp 
	- If > 50% response on induction -> chemoradiation therapy
	- If < 50% response on induction -> TL
- Was this a negative trial? #pimp 
	- Larynx preservation rates are high #emph
	- Organ preservation study
		- Is the organ preservation method safe (i.e. is survival compromised?)
		- This trial showed organ preservation is safe
- T4 tumors have much higher salvage rates (favor just doing surgery at the outset)

>[!summary] 
> How should we approach locally advanced disease? Is larynx preservation possible?
> - The VA Larynx trial was a landmark study in the 80s where they randomized 330 patients with Stage III/IV disease to Total Laryngectomy (+PORT) or an attempt at larynx preservation. Those patients underwent 2c of platinum-based chemo and then, if they had any kind of response, they underwent definitive RT up to 76 Gy. If there was no response, they underwent TL. 
> - The results showed that, in 2/3rds of patients, larynx preservation is possible with equivalent OS. 
> - Salvage TLs were required in a quarter of T2/3s but more than half of T4s. 
> - QOL was (unsurprisingly) better with the larynx preservation approach
