ASCO Guideline: [Use of Larynx-Preservation Strategies in the Tx of Laryngeal Cancer](https://www.asco.org/research-guidelines/quality-guidelines/guidelines/head-and-neck-cancer#/10261) November 27, 2017

# notes
- T1/2: TORS vs RT
- T3/4: Larynx preservation attempt via PL or CCRT.
	- PL only should be attempted if -SM are possible, otherwise just do RT. **No value to debulking**. 
- T3/4 with poor Lx function or large lesions: TL
	- see [[Beitler (T4 Lx review)]]
- cN+ with cCR after CCRT: no END required
	- *END required on [[VA larynx ({TL,PORT} v {IChemo+RT (Lx preservation})]], [[RTOG 9111 ({RT} v {ICRT} v {CCRT})]]*
	- Neck should always get ENI
- Salvage: always TL (even if PL is technically possible)
