> {RT alone} vs. {CisP/5FU x3 → RT ([[VA larynx ({TL,PORT} v {IChemo+RT (Lx preservation})#study|VA regimen]])} vs. {CCRT}.

# study
- 547 pts 
	- Glottic/SGL (70%). 
	- Excluded T1, large volume T4 (>1 cm BOT or through thyroid cart) 
		- ∴ 10% pts T4.
		- T4 exclusion due to [[VA larynx ({TL,PORT} v {IChemo+RT (Lx preservation})#salvage|VA larynx results]]

- Treatment
	- RT
		- All arms got 70 Gy. 
	- iCRT: 
		- CDDP 100, 5-FU 1g for 5 days on d1, 22 ± 43.
		- Response eval after 2c chemo (15% < PR rec surgery).
		- basically the [[VA larynx ({TL,PORT} v {IChemo+RT (Lx preservation})#study|VA regiment]] 
	- CCRT
		- CCRT with CDDP 100 on d1, 22 ± 43.
	- Pts with single LN ≥ 3 cm or multiple LN underwent LND 8w after completion of therapy.
- Primary endpoint: LFS.

| 10y             | RT  | ICRT | CCRT   |
| --------------- | --- | ---- | ------ |
| LFS             | 17  | 29   | 24     |
| Lx preservation | 64  | 68   | ==82== |
| LC              | 50  | 54   | 69     |
| LRC             | 47  | 49   | 65     |
| DC              | 76  | 83   | 84     |
| DFS             | 15  | 20   | 22     |
| OS              | 32  | 39   | 28     |

- Laryngeal preservation for RT alone superior to [[VA larynx ({TL,PORT} v {IChemo+RT (Lx preservation})|VA]], likely due to less T4.

## toxicity
- 2y swallowing difficulty ~15%. 
- PEG tube dependency < 3%.
- Deaths not attributed to cancer: 17→ 21→ 31%. Is there late toxicity of CDDP? 

# notes
- What method is best for Organ Preservation?
	- [[VA larynx ({TL,PORT} v {IChemo+RT (Lx preservation})#study|VA regiment]] vs. RT alone vs. CCRT
	- CCRT is the winner (based on larynx preservation advantage)
- Downsides to proving that CCRT is a reasonable strategy
	- [Olson 2010]"Reexamining the Treatmen of Adcanced Laryngeal Cancer"
		- see [[Beitler (T4 Lx review)]] for updated context
		- Lx OS rates started to creep downwards after RTOG 9111 came out.

>[!summary] 
> If Lx preservation is possible, what is the optimal combination/sequencing of chemo and RT?
> - RTOG 9111 tested this in 550 mostly T2/3 patients. They were randomized to 70 Gy of RT, either alone, with induction chemo, or with concurrent chemo. 
> - The results favored CCRT with about a 15% advantage in Lx preservation and LC and trends towards improved LRC and DM. This didn't translate to a survival benefit.
> - Toxicity was equivalent, but there was a 10-15% increase in non-cancer deaths with CCRT.
