# Epidemiology
- 2500 cases in US
	- 5-6% of all H&N cancers
- Benign more common in women and young
- malignant more common in men and old

# Anatomy
- The submandibular glands are the most important producer of saliva, particularly the mucinous component.

## Major Salivary Glands
- function saliva to digest

### Parotid
- most common site (70%, 75% benign)
- behind ramus of mandible
- Drains to the oral cavity via Stensen's duct, which is behind the upper 2nd molar.
- Facial nerve
	- exits stylomastoid foramen
	- separates superficial and deep lobes
	- Branches:
		- Temporal, Zygomatic, Buccal, Marg. Mandibular, Cervical
- Auriculotemporal nerve (V3)
	- innervates parotid (salivation/parasympathetic)
	- Frey syndrome (sweating/flushing of skin when eating)

| #emph           | border              |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| anterior  | 2nd maxillary molar |
| posterior | mastoid tip/inferior angle of mandible         |
| superior  | zygomatic arch/EAC      |
| inferior  | posterior digastric |
| deep      | IJ                  |

### Submandibular
- only 8% (usually _Adenoid Cystic_)
- borders: superior medial pterygoid and mylohoid
	- don't confuse with them #emph
- Drains into OC via Wharton's duct on the floor of the mouth.
- innervated by chorda tympani
	- risk for PN spread to CN XII, lingual nerve -> CNV, chorda tympani -> CN VII

### Sublingual
- between mylohyoid and FOM mucosa
	- included in Oral Cavity contour (no use to contour as OAR)
- Drains into OC via Bartholin's duct.
- usually _adenoid cystic_

## Minor Salivary Glands
- Mostly hard palate (38%) > tongue/lips (20%), but throughout OC, paranasal sinuses, pharynx
- 75% malignant, mostly adenoid cystic
	- the crazy histologies arise from these glands
- function: lubricate surfaces

## Lymphatics
- The rate of occult neck nodal metastases in parotid malignancies is low, with neck level II the most commonly involved (17%).[Warshavsky ASO '20](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33175260/)

# Histology
## Benign Salivary Tumors
### Pleomorphic Adenoma
- Most common benign
	- 5% risk of malignant transformation (usually at  recurrence)
	- Carcinoma ex-pleomorphic adenoma degeneration < 1% (4% at  recurrence)
- Treatment
	- Surgery has < 5% LR.
		- Don't spill! Tumor spillage has 45% LR.
	- Consider RT 50-60 Gy for multiple recurrences, deep involvement or large tumors.

### Warthin's tumor/papillary Cystadenoma Lymphomatosum
- Second most common.
	- Male smokers.
- Bilateral in 10-15%.
- Highly PET avid, commonly incidental finding #emph
- Degeneration < 1% therefore observation is reasonable.

### Godwin's Tumor
- Benign lymphoepithelial lesion, associated with Sjogren syndrome.

### Basal Cell Adenoma
- Only 2% of salivary tumors. May be confused with basal mets to the parotid.

### Oncocytoma/Monomorphic Adenoma
- 1% of salivary tumors. Firm. Older patients, slowly progressive.

## Low Grade

### Pleomorphic Adenoma
- (4% may transform if recurrent - avoid spillage), low grade mucoepidermoid, and acinic cell.

#### Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma
- Most LG, small, and curable by surgery alone.
- predominately in parotid gland
- High grade mucoepidermoid metastasize early to lymph nodes and have a poor prognosis.

#### Acinic Cell
- Low grade, slowly progressive.
- Most within parotid.
	- The third most common cancer of the parotid gland.
- SM tumors are uncommon, most aggressive.
- “Long con” histology like adenoid cystic (can be high grade) #emph , as can recur or present with DM years later. OS at 5 / 20y of 90→ 55%.

#### Polymorphous Adenocarcinoma
- Most commonly in minor salivary glands of the soft palate. **Rare in the parotid**.
- Easily confused with pleomorphic adenoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma.
- Usually indolent, but can be unpredictable with PNI and LN mets.

## Intermediate Grade

### Adenoid Cystic (> 30% Solid Component is High grade)
- Very high rate of PNI
- Nodal metastasis in up to 30%
- Slow-growing DM in up to 50% (lungs).
	- can occur years or decades later
- Local recurrences are common.
- Subtypes (most to least favorable)
	- Tubular → cribriform → solid.
	- Solid pattern >30% = high grade

## High Grade
### Adenocarcinoma and HG Mucoepidermoid
- at least a 33% chance of nodal mets

### Carcinoma Ex Pleomorphic Adenoma
- 4% of salivary tumors, 12% of malignancies.
- More than 80% of patients do not have a known history of pleomorphic adenoma.

### Salivary Duct Carcinoma
- 9% of salivary cancer.
- M:F 4:1.
- Aggressive, HG, similar to HG breast IDC.

### Metastasis to Salivary Glands
- 5% of salivary cancer. Incidence varies by frequency of skin cancer, mostly SqCC of skin, followed by melanoma.

### Epithelial-myoepithelial
- 1% of salivary cancer.
- M:F 1:2.
- Most parotid, slow growing.
- Grade predictive of nodes: Only 10% have nodes for G1-2 while 50% have nodes for G3.

### Lymphoepithelial Carcinoma
- Associated with EBV in Asian and Inuit populations.

### Adenoid Cystic
- mostly low-grade (see [[ECRO Salivary#Low Grade|above]]), but can behave as high-grade

# Staging
![[img_ECRO Salivary_stage.png#invert]]

# Workup
## H&P
- Slowly progressive, painless mass.
- Neuropathic pain/neuropathy from CNVII PNI with adenoid cystic #emph
- CN exam

## RF
- Not clearly defined. Some evidence for Hiroshima/Nagasaki survivors.
- Smoking only RF for Warthin's tumor.
- EBV in lymphoepithelial carcinoma.

## Imaging
- Ultrasound for initial workup.
- CT H&N with contrast
- PET/CT for Stage III-IV.
- MRI if indicated (NPX, paranasal sinuses, parotid).

## Biopsy
- FNA or core bx.
	- Sn 80%, Sp >95%

# Treatment

## Surgery
- All go to surgery if technically resectable.
	- Avoid spillage
		- (nearly 50% LR with pleomorphic adenoma, higher degeneration),
	- Avoid enucleation.
- Facial nerve
	- should not be sacrificed if at all possible (even if it means falling from R0 to R1)
		- Grafting options include the greater auricular nerve or sural nerve from the leg.
- Elective nodal dissection
	- II-III ± IV based on RF (size, stage, grade, histo, location).
	- only if G3 or cN+
	- Only need ipsilateral neck dissection.
		- RT to contralateral neck if multilevel nodes and >50% node positive.
- Margins
	- benign tumors: 1-2 mm
	- small, low-grade tumors: superficial parotidectomy with  1.5 cm margins
	- Otherwise, total parotidectomy is necessary.

### Superficial Parotidectomy
- resection of tumor superficial to CN7.

### Total Parotidectomy
- resection of the tumor and entire parotid with nerve sparing.

### Radical Parotidectomy
- Total + sacrifice CN7.

## Systemic Therapy
- KEYNOTE 158 [Even EJC '22](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35777186/)
	- ORR 5% (1 CR, 4 PR).
	- ORR for PD-L1+ 11%.
	- DOR was ≥ 24 mo for all 5 responders. MDOR NR.
- Axitinib: [Keam ASCO '20](https://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/187174/abstract)
	- 6 mo PFS 23→ 73%.
	- MPFS 3→ 11 mo.
	- MS ~28 mo→ NR.
	- Disease control rate 0→ 100%.

# RLD
## NCCN
- management is surgery-driven
	- Neck dissection dependent on primary site
- adjuvant treatment is typically RT
	- except for lG with -SM [[Cho]]
	- tumor spillage is questionable (historical indication for pleomorphic adenoma)
- Systemic therapy is category 2b
- treat every Adenoid cystic like they have PNI (even if not documented)

## RT
### PORT
- Chen #emph
	- factors that predict for LRR after surgery (similar to [[Terhaard]])
	- guides when we add PORT (pretty much always)
- Many retrospectives showing that PORT improves outcomes

### Definitive RT
- [[Mendenhall (RT v Sx+PORT)]]. Not advised

### ENI
- Chen 2007
	- should treat the neck for high-grades
	- except adenoid cystic #emph where it's reasonable to observe
- Herman 2013
	- cN0: ENI is just as good as END (may be better)
	- Thus, do END if it's easy, but don't go out of your way (ENI does well)

## Principles
![[img_ECRO Salivary_RLD-summary.png#invert]]
### Treat with Surgery in All Cases
- Push for GTR
- CN7 sacrificed only if it means R2 otherwise

### Don't Treat with Pimary RT
- [[Mendenhall (RT v Sx+PORT)]]

### No Role for chemoRT
- [[Amini (NCDB)]]
- ongoing [RTOG 1008]([NCT01220583](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01220583))

### Adjuvant RT indications
#### benign/low-grade
- positive margins, multiply recurrent
- otherwise omit ([[Cho]])
#### high-grade
- everything ([[Terhaard]], Chen) 

### ENI
![[img_ECRO Salivary_RlD-ENI-summary.png#invert]]
### PORT
![[Pasted image 20240126084040.png#invert]]
- PNI: must distinguish if it was due to cancer or operation (present pre-op?). #pimp Can you see it on MR?
	- determines if you need to chase the nerves
		- except Adenoid Cystic (where you always need to chase)
- Neck:
	- depends on subsite
