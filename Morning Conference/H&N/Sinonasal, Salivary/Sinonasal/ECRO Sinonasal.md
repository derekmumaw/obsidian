# Epidemiology
- ~2,000 cases per year, 1/100,000
	- < 1% of all tumors; 3% of all H&N tumors
	- Incidence is higher in Japan and South Africa
- M:F 2:1
- 60-70yo

# Risk Factors
- Nickel, Wood dust (500x risk for maxillary tumor), leather tanning agents, Industrial fumes, chromium, hydrocarbons, formaldehyde, nitrogen mustard, air pollution. _Potentially HPV and EBV._

# **Histology**
- SqCC (50-80%)
	- > AC > adenoid cystic > mucoepidermoid
	- >> SNUC, HMPC, esthesioneuroblastoma, melanoma, NUT,  angiosarcoma, RMS, small cell, lymphoma, plasmacytoma, mets.
- HPV: ~1/3 of cases. Associated with improved OS (see [Oliver Cancer ‘19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31886908))

# Anatomy
## Four Subsites of the Nasal Cavity
- Septum, floor, lateral wall, vestibule.
- Limen nasi: anterior border.
	- cutaneous SCC vs NC SCC

### Sphenopalatine Foramen
- sphenopalatine foramen -> pterygopalatine fossa #pimp
- ![[img_ECRO Sinonasal_PPF-3.png]]![[img_ECRO Sinonasal_PPF-2.png#invert]]
- sinonasal tumors can follow nerves through the sphenopalatine foramen into the PPF where there is a huge network of nerves (and thus many ways for the nerve to spread) #emph

### Ohngren’s Line
- ![[img_ECRO Sinonasal_ohngren.png#invert|350]]
- theoretical plane extending from the medial canthus of the eye to the angle of the mandible. 
	- Above: supra-structure.
		- typically T3
	- Below: infra-structure.
		- resectable -> better prognosis

## Four Sinuses
- maxillary, ethmoids, frontal, sphenoid #pimp

### Maxillary
- Most common (70-80%), 70% SqCC
	- Highest rate of nodal mets at 10-15%.
- innervated by V2
	- infraorbital nerve (soft tissue of cheek): runs along anterior wall

|                | borders             |
| --------------:| ------------------- |
|       Anterior | Facial bone         |
|  Anterolateral | Zygomatic arch      |
| Posterolateral | Infratemporal fossa |
|      Posterior | PPF                 |
|       Superior | Orbital floor       |
|       Inferior | Hard palate         |
|         Medial | Nasal cavity        |

### Ethmoid
- May spread superiorly through cribriform plate into ACF or medially though lamina papyracea into orbit.
- Lamina papyracea
	- thin bone of medial orbital wall (prone to invasion by ethmoid sinus).

### Frontal
- innervated by supraobrital and supratrochlear nerves (V1)

### Sphenoid
- innervated by V1, V2

## Lymphatics
- level 1b/2a, retrostyloid, retropharygeal, > facial/buccal
- not very lymphatic though

# Histology
- SC
	- SCC
- Glandular
	- adenoca, adenoid cystic
- Neuroendocrine
	- Esthesio, SNUC
- Mesenchymal
	- PNET, Melanoma

# Staging
## AJCC
- Maxillary![[img_ECRO Sinonasal_staging.png#invert]]
	- T3: Posterior wall of maxillary sinus or PPF.
- NC/Ethmoid![[img_ECRO Sinonasal_staging-NC.png#invert]]

## Wang Classification for Nasal Vestibule
- T1: Superficial, limited to the nasal vestibule.
- T2: Extends to the skin of the nose, upper lip or nasal septum.
- T3: Extends into bone or deep muscle.

## Esthesioneuroblastoma
- A: Confined to the nasal cavity.
- B: Extends to **paranasal sinus**.
- C: Extends **beyond** paranasal sinus (including skull base, orbit, or cribriform plate).
- D: Extends to Cervical LNs and beyond.

# **Workup**
## History
- chronic sinusitis patient. Lots of missed diagnoses early on. Usually becomes locally advanced before it's diagnosed #emph
- Asymptomatic > facial asymmetry, facial pain, epistaxis, sinus obstruction, trismus, ocular deficits

## Benign DDx
- sinonasal polyposis, choanal polyps, juvenile angiofibroma.

## Imaging
- CT sinus
- MRI orbit/face/neck
	- Fat suppresion is important to assess orbital invasion #emph
	- use T2 to determine fluid vs tumor #emph
- PET/CT if stage III/IV

## Biopsy
- endoscopic

# Treatment
- LF is predominate mode of failure (rarely met out) #emph
	- bad salvage options
	- thus low threshold for intensifying treatment
- Do a big resection (little endoscopic resections don't do as well)
- There is no RCT data due to rare disease and various presentations, making adequate powering difficult.
- NCDB [Robin Cancer '17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6234843/)
	- Multimodality therapy is associated with improved OS
	- Surgery: PORT HR 0.658, POCCRT HR 0.696, NAC/RT HR 0.656.
	- NACCRT is associated with achieving a negative surgical margin (OR 2.641).
	- RT alone HR 1.294, Chemo alone HR 1.834.

## Surgery
- Partial or total maxillectomy to negative margins. For smaller tumors, ESS use is increasing.
- Surgery followed by PORT for NC seems superior compared to either modality alone [[Guntinas-Lichius (Sx and-or RT)]]
- ENI for maxillary sinus SqCC [[Bristol (RT ± ENI)]]

## Radiation
- Definitive RT ± CTX is the first line for T4b, but 2B for T3-4a, N0.
- Primary RT: G3 or G1 tumors > 1.5 cm GTV + 2 cm.
- RT alone may be appropriate for T1N0 disease, with 5y OS > 70% for 55/20 [Jeannon Clin Oto '07](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17298305/)
- Manchu fields to cover facial lymphatics
	- ![[img_ECRO Sinonasal_manchu.png|100]]

## Inverted Papilloma
- Only 10% invasive. If an invasive component is found at surgery, give 65-70 Gy [1](https://insights.ovid.com/pubmed?pmid=17921720)

# RLD
- Big surgery gives best oncologic outcome, especially with PORT
	- [[Guntinas-Lichius (Sx and-or RT)]]
	- early stage, non-adenoid cystic, can consider avoiding
	- otherwise, give PORT
- induction? Controversial
	- [[Amit (SNUC iChemo)]]
- Sinonasal needs to be
