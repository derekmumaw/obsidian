# study

- 95 pts. 
	- Single BM
	- GTR by MRI 
	- 70 KPS
	- MFU nearly 1y
- RT dose chosen to achieve a 90% microscopic disease control probability
	- Issue: Roughly 60% of the observation arm got WBRT

>[!summary] 
>- We know patients will benefit from surgical resection from Patchell #1, so the control arm in this study was R0 resections.
>- WBRT improves local control and decreases neurological death, but has the same time to functional decline.
>- There is a 50% failure rate after R0 surgery alone.
