# study
- 508 pts
	- 149 pts analyzable @ 6 mo (expected 442)
	- MS 7 mo
- Time to NCF is defined as the first cognitive failure on any of the neurocognitive tests
- Memantine 20 mg/d vs placebo for 24 weeks. 
	- Week 1: 5 mg/day.
	- Week 2: 5 mg BID.
	- Week 3: 5 mg AM, 10 mg PM.
	- Week 4: 10 mg BID→ week 24.
- Primary endpoint delay HVLT-R at 6 mo.

# results
| 6m     | WBRT | +memantine |
| ------ | ---- | ---------- |
| 6m NCF | 65   | 54         |

- Rate of decline slowed by 4 mo in both arms, more so in memantine.
- 6m HVLT-R improved but p=0.059. Only 35% statistical power due to greater than expected pt loss rates.
- Time to NCF HR 0.78. 
- Improved controlled word association test at 16w (verbal fluency) and Trail Making Test A (executive function) at 24w with memantine.

>[!summary] 
> Overall, memantine appears to delay time to cognitive decline and the rate of decline in memory, executive fxn, and processing speed in pts receiving WBRT. Notably, 34% of patients died before completing the 24 week assessment and were not included in the analysis. This large number of deaths along with non-compliance or withdrawal might help to explain why this study just missed statistical significance. Patients undergoing WBRT with a predicted survival of at least 3 mo should be considered for memantine.
