>[!intervention] 
> 15-24 Gy SRS {± 30/12 WBRT within 3 weeks}

# study
- 58 pts
	- 1-3 BM (58% single, < 4 cm)
	- KPS > 70.  RPA II 83%
	- MFU 10 mo.

# results
| 1y                     | SRS | +WBRT | Summary |
| ---------------------- | --- | ----- | ------- |
| LRR                    | 27  | 73    | 3x      |
| LC                     | 67  | 100   | 30%     |
| DBMC                   | 45  | 73    | 30%     |
| MS                     | 15m | 6m    | 1/2     |
| OS                     | 63  | 21    | 1/3     |
| Salvage                | 90  | 11    | 80%     |
| 4m HVLT/memory decline | 24  | 52    | 2x      |

- OS advantage in SRS group due to an imbalance in prognostic factors between arms and differences in salvage therapy?

>[!summary] 
> 30% local and distant control advantage, but worse OS, maybe due to poor balancing. 
> HVLT decline doubled at 4 mo with the addition of WBRT.
