>[!intervention] 
> 30/10 HA-WBRT.

# study
- 113 pts. 
	- NSCLC with 2+ extracranial sites excluded.
- Primary endpoint cognition via HVLT-R at 4 mo. Avoids NSC. 
- Planning
	- Hippo D100 < 9 Gy (10 Gy), Dmax < 16 Gy
	- Hippocampus PRV + 5 mm
	- RT volume to the bottom of C1, unless posterior fossa mets are present (C2).

# results
- 5% with new brain mets in hippocampus PRV. 
- Decline from baseline HVLT-R at 4 mo for historical WBRT / HA-WBRT of 30 â†’ 7%.
- Over 2/3 of patients developed intracranial progression

>[!summary] 
> Requires 5 mm from lesion to hippocampus. There is less decline from baseline HVLT-R at 4 mo vs. historical WBRT cohort.
