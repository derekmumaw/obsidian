# Epidemiology
- Most common intracranial tumors (240k/y)
	- incidence increasing (MRI, longer survival with modern treatment)
- up to 30% of patients with cancer
	- direct cause of death in 30-50% of these
- About half and half single vs. multiple brain mets

# Anatomy
- **Solitary**: No extracranial metastatic disease
- **Singular**: single brain met with extracranial disease

## Distribution
- Supratentorial (80%) > CBL (15%) > brainstem (5%)

## Location
- Frontal lobe, watershed (G-W junction, vessel diameter decreases, therefore traps cells), cerebellum (more likely GI/colon)

# Presentation
- Most common: HA, AMS and focal weakness in 33% to 50% with seizures and gait ataxia in 10-20%

# Pathology
- Overall incidence: Lung (50%) > breast (20%) > melanoma (10%) > colon (5%)
- Highest predilection: SCLC, melanoma, choriocarcinoma, germ cell
- Hemorrhagic, peripherally enhancing without contrast on CT: Melanoma, RCC, thyroid, and choriocarcinoma. 

# Workup
## Imaging
- Noncon CT head fist (rules out hemorrhage)
- MRI brain with/without Contrast
	- Thin cut MRI (1 mm slices) → 14% more brain mets than 2 mm slices; 25% more than 3 mm slices [Thrower ARO '21](https://www.advancesradonc.org/article/S2452-1094(21)00066-X/pdf)
	- Typically iso or hypointense on T1
	- hyperintense on T2

## Biopsy
### New Dx
- systemic imaging and biopsy.

### Existing Diagnosis → New Brain Mets
- if solitary: biopsy, otherwise biopsy other metastatic site
- if multiple: 95% metastases; biopsy not required for treatment

### LMD Suspected
- MRI spine,  LP in a patient with symptoms but negative MRI
- Three negative LPs required to be a "true" negative.
	- High protein, lymphocytosis, low glucose is suggestive
	- Obtaining an MRI post-LP increases risk of false positive from low pressure.

# Prognostication
- RTOG RPA
- GPA
	- Age, KPS, \#BM, Extracranial M
- Diagnosis-specific GPA
	- NSCLC, Breast, Renal, Melanoma, GI
- Brain metastases velocity
	- new BM/year
	- > 4 is prognostic

# Treatment
## Medical
### Decadron
- [[Vecht]] suggests starting at 8 mg BID then transitioning to 2mg BID after a week

#### Toxicity
- insomnia, hyperglycemia, irritability, weight gain
- Cushings, Gastric ulcers (GI PPX), osteopenia, proximal muscle weakness

### Memantine
- [[RTOG 0614 (WBRT ± Memantine)]]: Addition of mementine → delayed  time to cognitive decline and the lower rate of decline in memory, executive function, and processing speed. Low statistical power due to high dropout and patient deaths.

## Systemic Therapy
- Blood brain barrier
	- Molecule has to be < 400 daltons to pass BBB
	- Response rate for chemo alone 15-30%
- New targeted agents/immunotherapies can cross (EDFR, ALK, PDL-1, HER-2)
- Still need local therapy

## Surgery
- larger/symptomatic lesions
	- [[Patchell I (± Surgery + RT)]]: with a single met, surgery doubled MS and quadrupled functional independence over biopsy
- if tissue diagnosis needed
- LMS rate increases following Surgery
	- 16% risk after surgery found on MA
	- Rationale for ongoing preop-SRS studies ([PROPS-BM] KCL!)

## RT
- cornerstone for brain metastases treatment
- exception: poor prognosis ([[Quartz (low KPS ± WBRT)]])
### Toxicity
#### acute
- Fatigue, headaches, nausea, vomiting, ototoxicity
	- Flonase for ototoxicity
#### Chronic
- alopecia, memory, executive function, leukoencephalopathy, brain atrophy, radiation necrosis

### Post-op
- [[Patchell II (± postop RT)]]: LR quadrupled with surgery alone and death from neurologic cause tripled. Postop-RT is required.

### WBRT and/or SRS
- [[RTOG 9508 (WBRT ± SRS boost)]]: better LC with SRS boost, but no survival benefit. Small (1-2m) MS benefit for those with 1x BM, RPA class I, and size > 2cm
- [[Aoyama (SRS ± WBRT)]]: reverse design of ^. 30% lower recurrences, but no survival benefit. Cuts need for salvage in 1/4.
- [[Chang (SRS ± WBRT)]]: Again, 30% lower recurrences, but now a survival detriment (?). Doubling in neurocognition detriment though.
- [[N107C (WBRT v SRS)]]: Less cognitive decline with SRS. Unexpectedly worse LC on initial analysis. Worse elsewhere failure.  

### SRS
- Dose per [[RTOG 9005 (SRS dose-escalation)]]: 
	-  ≤ 2cm: 24 Gy
	- \>2-3cm: 18 Gy
	- \>3-4cm: 15 Gy
- [[Yamamoto (SRS 5-10 v 2-4)]]: Safe up to 10 tumors (equivalent MS to 2-4 tumors)
- [Mitti]: rationale for fractionation

### Hippocampal Avoidance
- [[RTOG 0933 (HA-WBRT)]]: Proof of concept. Only 5% LF in 5mm hippocampus PRV. 4m HVLT-R decline in 7% (compare to 30% historical controls)
- [[NRG CC001 (WBRT ± HA)]]: Better neurocognition without increased rates of failure. If survival expected to be >4m, HA should be SOC.
	- Hippocampal D100% ≤ 9 Gy,  Dmax ≤ 16 Gy
