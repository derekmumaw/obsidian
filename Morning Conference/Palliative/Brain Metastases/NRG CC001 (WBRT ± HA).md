>[!intervention]
> 6 mo Memantine + 30/10 ± HA.�

# Study
- 518 pts.
	- KPS >70, 85% RPA class II (MS 4 mo).
	- Brain-only mets ~40%.
	- All > 5mm from hippo
	- MFU 8 mo.
- Primary endpoint:
	- NCD on HVLT-R, TMT-A/B, COWA. 
- Hypothesis: HA will increase 6 mo TTF from 54% to 65%.

## RT
- CTV_3000: Whole brain parenchyma to bottom of foramen magnum. 
- PTV_3000: CTV_3000 excluding the hippocampal avoidance region. No set-up margin is added.
- PTV D90-95% ≥ 30 Gy, PTV D98% ≥ 75% (22.5 - 25 Gy), PTV D2% < 125% (37.5 - 40 Gy). 
- Hippocampal D100% ≤ 9 Gy (10 Gy), Dmax ≤ 16 Gy (17 Gy). 
- Optic apparatus (ON, OC) Dmax ≤ 30 Gy (37.5 Gy).

# Results
| results                       | WBRT | +HA  |
| ----------------------------- | ---- | ---- |
| 6m cognitive failure          | 63   | 55   |
| 4m Executive function decline | 40   | 23   |
| 6m Learning decline           | 25   | 12   |
| 6m memory decline             | 33   | 16   |
| Intracranial MPFS             | 5.3m | 5m   |
| MS                            | 7.6m | 6.3m |
| G3+                           | 20   | 20     |

- The beneficial effect of HA did not differ by age ± 61y. 6 mo cognitive failure for ± 61y (HR 0.61).
- Combined HR for memantine + HA of 0.78 * 0.75 = 0.58. Comparable HR to SRS trials in lieu of WBRT.
- At 6 mo, patients who received HA-WBRT reported less fatigue, less difficulty with remembering things and less difficulty with speaking. Imputed data reported less interference of neuro sx with ADL and fewer cognitive symptoms.
- Age (>61), education (< high school) irrespective of treatment arm were predictive of higher risk of NCF failure. 
- Patients living < 4 months derived no benefit from HA-WBRT, while patients living ≥ 4 mo benefitted from HA-WBRT. 
- Patients with lung histology and those with lower baseline MDASI-BT cognitive factors scores (denoting less severe cognitive impairment at enrollment) had significantly greater benefit from HA-WBRT.

>[!summary]
> "For brain metastasis patients eligible to receive whole-brain radiotherapy and whose survival is expected to be 4 months or longer, hippocampal avoidance using intensity-modulated radiotherapy should be considered standard of care"
> Tsien of Wash U [2018](https://www.medpagetoday.com/meetingcoverage/astro/75904): Cognitive impairment is observed in more than 50% of pts who receive WBRT, and 20% of cancer pts overall. HA-WBRT appears to be cost-effective only in pts with longer prognoses (≥ 12 mo) according to 2014 Medicare costs: WBRT alone $6,513. WBRT-HA $9,905. SRS $9,183. Follow-up MRI $646.
