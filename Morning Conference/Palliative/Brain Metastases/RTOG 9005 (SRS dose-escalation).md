> RTOG 9005 [Shaw IJROBP '00](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360301699005076?via%3Dihub): Phase I. 

>[!intervention] 
> Dose escalation study: 24 Gy (< 2 cm), 18 Gy (2-3 cm), 15 Gy (3-4 cm).

# study
- 158 pts. 
	- All recurrent (i.e. prior WBRT) #pimp
		- 64% BM 
		- 36% primary brain tumor (60 Gy). 
		- Average 17 mo prior to SRS.

# results
- Started at 18 / 15 / 12 Gy and concluded lesions < 2 / 2-3 / 3-4 cm should be treated to 24→ 18→ 15 Gy.
- Based on CNS toxicity < 20% within 3 mo of SRS.
- However, for tumors < 2 cm, reluctance to escalate to 27 Gy rather than excessive toxicity determined max.
- GTV = tumor. No PTV. Rx to 50-90% IDL.
- 2y actuarial risk of radionecrosis of 11%.
- Radionecrosis requiring reoperation in 9%. MTTRN 5 mo (range 4-27 mo).

> This established SRS dosing for later trials. On MVA, increasing dose was not associated with LC.
This is not a radiation necrosis trial! It defined toxicity with 3 months of SRS.
Lesions ≥ 2.1 cm with LC just under 50%. This is why [multifraction SRS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CfbqB4YnaPB8U3r2LykLv2v3bRLJyYQV0tvX4Js2Mog/edit#bookmark=id.9lcd23l98cfa)] is considered for lesions > 2 cm as opposed to 18 Gy in one fraction. 20 Gy to the periphery of PTV (GTV + 1-2 mm) on [[EORTC 22952](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CfbqB4YnaPB8U3r2LykLv2v3bRLJyYQV0tvX4Js2Mog/edit#bookmark=id.au4xojwx7qu5), even if up to 3.5 cm.
