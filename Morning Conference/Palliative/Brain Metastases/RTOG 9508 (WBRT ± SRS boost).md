>[!intervention] 
> 37.5/15 WBRT {± SRS 18-24 Gy within 1 week}

# study
- 333 pts. 
	- 1-3 BM, < 4 cm. 
	- KPS ≥ 70. RPA I (25%) and II (75%). 
	- 19% dropout in SRS group.
- 37.5/15 WBRT
	- based on a 1989 retrospective report of 12 pts with dementia and long survival 
		- suggested 300 cGy/fx → greater likelihood of late effects 
		- highly criticized for reported radiation total doses and fractionation schemes
- SRS dosing per [RTOG 90-05]: 
	- 24 Gy: < 2 cm
	- 18 Gy: 2-3 cm
	- 15 Gy: 3-4 cm
- LINAC and gamma knife outcomes curves were superimposed.

>[!summary] 
> Addition of SRS to WBRT improved LC and KPS, but no change in overall survival.
> subgroup analysis: small (1-2m) MS benefit for 1 BM, RPA Class I, and tumors > 2cm.
