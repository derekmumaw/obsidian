> SRS with 5-10 BM vs. 2-4 BM.

# Study
- 1194 pts. 
	- 1998-2017 
	- 1-10 BM 
	- < 3 cm (largest lesion < 10 cc, total cumulative volume ≤ 15 cc) 
		- Cumulative tumor volume (very low) 
			- 1 / 2-4 / 5-10 tumors 
			- 2.3→ 3.1→ 3.5 cc
	- KPS ≥ 70
	- MFU among the 30% of survivors of 21 mo.
- Primary endpoint OS, 
	- non-inferiority margin set as HR 1.3.
## RT
- 22 Gy for < 4 cc, 20Gy for 4-10 cc 
- Brainstem 
	- < 1 / 4 / 10 cc
	- 20→ 18→ 16 Gy

# Results
| 2y          | 1   | 2-4 | 5-10 |
| ----------- | --- | --- | ---- |
| MS          | 14  | 11  | 11   |
| new lesions | 48  | 66  | 72   |
| new LMD     | 11  | 13  | 22   |

- Overall rate of salvage SRS 38%, a little higher for 5-10 brain mets. Only 9% had salvage WBRT.
- Grade 3 toxicity ≤ 3%.
- Only 1 patient developed radionecrosis (?!). 
- Cause of death was extracranial 92% of the time.
- MMSE was utilized for neurologic assessment.
- test

>[!summary]
> Patients with 2-4 mets vs. 5-10 mets have similar overall survival. 
The vast majority of patients died from systemic disease, not brain disease.
