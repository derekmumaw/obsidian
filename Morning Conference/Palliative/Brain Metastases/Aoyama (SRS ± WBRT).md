>[!intervention] 
> SRS {± 30/10 WBRT}

# study
- 132 pts, 
	- 1-4 BM (< 3 cm), 
	- KPS > 70. RPA II 85%. 
- Primary endpoint OS, but closed early.
- SRS (18-25 Gy) ± 30/10 (SRS dose decreased by 30% in the arm receiving WBRT).  
- For SRS alone: < 2 cm 18-20 Gy, < 2 cm 22-25 Gy.
- test

- Time to Death (neuro cause) marginally prolonged with addition of WBRT

>[!summary] 
> Addition of WBRT with marginally slows time to NCD and increases local control over SRS alone.
