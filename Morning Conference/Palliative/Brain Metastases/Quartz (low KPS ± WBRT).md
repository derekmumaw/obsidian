# study
- 538 pts
	- NSCLC with BM
	- Inoperable/non-SRSable
	- ~50% RPA 2 (MS 4 mo), ~40% RPA 3 (MS 2 mo) 
	- 80% DS-GPA 0-2
	- \>65y with > 1 brain met or poor KPS
		- ~40% with KPS < 70%
- Non-inferiority study, pre-specified non-inferiority boundary of seven days. 

# results
- No difference in QALY (~5 days). 
	- Significantly more drowsiness, hair loss, nausea, and dry/itchy scalp.
- MS ~9w regardless of WBRT
- Subset analysis
	- OS benefit for age < 60y, >5 BM, GPA > 2.5
	- Strong trend for KPS >70, no extracranial mets,

The QUARTZ study only had less than a QUARTer of patients with good prognosis. Non-inferiority margin was not met (margin specified to be QALY of -7 days but the result was −4·7, 90% CI = -12.7- +3.3). Subanalysis demonstrated OS favoring WBRT for patients < 60y or ≥ 5 mets.
TL;DR (2022): Supportive therapy alone is reasonable for patients with KPS < 70% and systemic disease with no good systemic therapy options.
