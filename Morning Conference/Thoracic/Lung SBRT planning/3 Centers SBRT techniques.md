- How three academic centers prescribe SBRT for Primary Lung Cancer [De Leo PRO '22](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35219881/)

## Institutions
- UFlorida, MSKCC, and MDACC
	- VALOR, PAC-4, RTOG 0813/0915
- patient inclusion:
	- peripheral and central tumors 
		- up to 5 cm, 
		- **not** ultracentral tumors 
## Techniques
### Volumes
- GTV is verified in all phases of 4DCT
	- Some facilities contour on MIP
- add 5 mm PTV 
	- consider 10 mm cranio-caudal if no 4DCT
	- One facility adds a 2-3 mm CTV carved out of adjacent fixed structures
### Planning
- PTV D95% ≥ 100%. 
	- One facility mandates GTV D100 ≥ 110-120% Rx 
		- this facility routinely delivers an SIB to the GTV
- PTV V90% ≥ 99%
- Dmax 
	- no limit
	- One facility mandates a maximum dose no less than Dmax of 115% 
- Conformity Index
	- ≤ 1.5 and R50% (only one institution) 
	- Ongoing protocols
		- CI < 1.2 ideal, < 1.5 acceptable.
- OAR metrics > target coverage
