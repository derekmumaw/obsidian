# Notes
1. when is SBRT appropriate for *operable* T1/2N0 NSCLC?
	- Surgeons always get first crack
		- better N staging, you get path, and the tumor is removed
	- Mostly because we know Surgery works well long-term, but that data is lacking for SBRT. 
	- If the only surgery they can tolerate is sublobar resection, then consider SBRT (though this may have changed in light of the new equivalence studies)
		- FEV1 < 50% predicted, DLCO <50% predicted, or a combination of advanced age, impaired pulmonary function, pulmonary hypertension, poor left ventricular function.
2. when is SBRT appropriate for *inoperable* T1/2N0 NSCLC 
	- **Centrally located**: Risky. Should use at least 4-5 fx, up to 15fx
	- **> 5cm in diameter**: it's fine, but be careful
	- **Lacking tissue confirmation**: try to get a biopsy, but if you need to, SBRT is oka (after multiD)
	- **Synchronous/multifocal tumors**: Hard to differentiate from metastatic disease (multiD). Do lots of staging. SBRT is still fine though. 
	- **s/p pneumonectomy**: SBRT is fine
- SBRT
