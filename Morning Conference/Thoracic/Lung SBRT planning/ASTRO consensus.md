# Notes
## 1. When is SBRT Appropriate for _operable_ T1/2N0 NSCLC?
### Surgeons Always Get First Crack
- no great data to answer this question
	- i.e. we know Surgery works well long-term, but that data is lacking for SBRT.
	- see[STARS-ROSEL] for a counterpoint
	> STARS-ROSEL was a pooled analysis of MD Anderson's STARS and the Dutch ROSEL studies.
	> Both trials randomized patients with <4cm operable NSCLC to VATS lobectomy with MLND or SABR, either 54/3 if peripheral or 50/4 or 60/8 if central.The results showed a dramatic 15% OS advantage in favor of SABR and 4x less G3-4 toxicity.
	> An expanded cohort from STARS was also published, but the results were more conservative, only demonstrating non-inferiority (though the HR of 0.86 is still in favor of SABR)

- better N staging,
- you get path,
- and the tumor is removed

### If the only Surgery They Can Tolerate is Sublobar Resection, then Consider SBRT (though This May Have Changed in light of the New Equivalence studies)
- ==FEV1 < 50% predicted, DLCO <50% predicted==, or a combination of advanced age, impaired pulmonary function, pulmonary hypertension, poor left ventricular function.

## When is SBRT Appropriate for _inoperable_ T1/2N0 NSCLC
### Centrally Located
- Risky. Should use at least 4-5 fx, up to 15fx

### > 5cm In Diameter
- it's fine, but be careful

### Lacking Tissue Confirmation
- try to get a biopsy, but if you need to, SBRT is ok (after multiD)

### Synchronous/multifocal Tumors
- Hard to differentiate from metastatic disease (multiD). Do lots of staging. SBRT is still fine though.

### s/p Pneumonectomy
- SBRT is fine
## SBRT technique
### Ultracentral
- 4-5 fx when in close proximity to the proximal bronchial tree
- use [[Planning#RTOG 0813|RTOG 0813 constraints]]
