# study
- 246 pts #pimp 
	- IIIA/B (70% IIIB) #pimp 
		- More than 95% were PET-staged.
	- 2/3 received a lobectomy. 
	- Primary outcome: OS #pimp 
- induction CisP+Paclitaxel q3w x3c #pimp → HFX CCRT CisP+Venorelbine 1.5 BID to 45 Gy #pimp → (panel discussion if operable)→ 65-71 Gy with CisP+Venorelbine #pimp vs. Surgery #pimp 

# results
- pCR 33% in the surgery arm
- 5y OS 40 v 44%.  #pimp 
- 5y PFS ~35 v 32% #pimp
- Risk of death from pneumonectomy ZERO #pimp 

>[!summary] 
> These patients were optimally selected for surgery, with panel discussion for operability. 
Both approaches resulted in excellent outcomes.  However, the trial closed early due to slow accrual and was not appropriately powered.
