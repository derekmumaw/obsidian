# Study
- 501 pts #pimp
	- completely resected with pN2 #pimp
	- PET/CT (91%)
	- Chemo (96%; pre 18%, post 78%).
	- Pneumonectomy ~11%.
		- Complete R0 resection according to IASLC definition was confirmed only in 29% of patients.
	- Primary (2° ) Endpoint: DFS (OS, LC, POF)
	- MFU 4.8y.
- RT
	- 4-8 weeks postop or 2-6 weeks postchemo #pimp
	- *3D (89%)*,  IMRT (11%)
	- Volumes
		- resected CTV: involved resected LN stations, bronchial stump. ipsi hilum, adjacent mediastinal pleura
		- CTV: ^+1cm, one LN level above/below, subcarina, ipsi LN4
		- PTV: 0.5cm radially, 1cm sup/inf
	- RT Constraints
		- Lung V20 < 31% after lobectomy; <22% after pneumonectomy
		- Heart V35 < 30%. 
		- Median V20 23%, MLD 12.7 Gy. MHD 13.4 Gy. Heart V35 15%.

>[!summary]
> No DFS benefit (actually suggestions of detriment). Better LRC, risk of death increased, likely driven by toxicity. This is 3D/static IMRT era so we need a VMAT version of this trial.
> - 3y DFS was higher than expected in both arms and PORT was associated with a non-significant 15% relative increase in DFS among stage IIIAN2 patients.
> - PORT for resected, N2 NSCLC reduced the risk of mediastinal recurrence by an absolute 20%, but there wasn’t a significant improvement in disease-free survival.
> - Although PORT halves the rate of mediastinal relapse for resected N2 NSCLC, the benefit is insufficient to overcome the effect of metastatic progression and the potential adverse cardiopulmonary effects on overall survival.
