> CCRT 45/25→ ({Surgery if no PD} v {CCRT 61.2 Gy}) → Adjuvant CE x2c

# Study
- 396 resectable pts.
	- T1-3pN2: IIIA #pimp
- Treatment
	- CEx2 + 45/25 → {if no PD: Surgery} v { boost to 61.2 Gy} → CE x2. 
	- RT was 2D and large

# Results
| 5y   | RT+Surgery | RT+RT |
| ---- | ---------- | ----- |
| iLF  | 22         | 10    |
| PFS  | 22         | 11    |
| MPFS | 10.5       | 12.8  |
| OS   | 27         | 20    |

- Pneumonectomy operative mortality rate 8% overall, or 26% for right sided pneumonectomy
	- ARDS
- Exploratory analysis suggests Lobectomy is better than CCRT alone with MS 22→ 33 mo.
	- For lobectomy, surgery doubles overall survival with 5y OS 18→ 36%.
	- 
![[img_Intergroup 0139_results2.png#invert]]
- Death without progression 18→ 10%.
- pCR 14%, with 5y OS 42% in pCR.
- Vince SEER: 0.6 HR in favor of trimodality (vs. definitive ChemoRT)

# Notes
- adding surgery didn't help OS (but did help mPFS)
- Biggest flaw was that the surgical mortality rates were unusually high
- Less applicable in the immunotherapy era

> RT was 2D and large (ENI). 50% were pN0 after 45 Gy!
> Exploratory analysis suggested lobectomy is better than CCRT alone. Pneumonectomy deaths are unrealistically high.
Modern surgeons are comfortable cutting after 50-60 Gy so long as it is within 3 months after treatment.
