# Study
- 232 pts.
	- IIIA-N2
	- Primary outcome: EFS

# Results
| results | C→RT→Sx | C→Sx |
| ------- | ------- | ---- |
| mEFS    | 13      | 12   |
| mOS     | 37      | 26   |
| R0      | ==91==  | 81   |

>[!summary]
> There appears to be no benefit with the addition of RT sequentially after induction chemo.
> slightly better R0 rates with RT (but doesn't translate to endpoints)
