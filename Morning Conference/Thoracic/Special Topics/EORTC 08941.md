# Study
- 579 pts.
	- Unresectable IIIA/N2 #pimp 
	- Induction chemo x3
	- {Surgery (±56Gy PORT)} v {RT (60-62.5 Gy)} #pimp 
	- Primary Outcome: OS #pimp
- RT:
	- 60-62 Gy to involved mediastinum
	- 46 Gy to uninvolved mediastinum
	- PORT to 56 Gy for SM+
		- 40% received PORT #pimp 
	- Only 55% compliance to RT prescription

# Results
- MS ~16 v 17.5 mo #pimp
	- OS HR: 1.06
	- PFS HR: 1.06
- LRF 55→ 32%
- DM 39→ 61% 
- analyzing the surgical arm, PORT increases MS by 4 months (p=.004) #emph 

>[!summary]
> RT is not better than Surgey±RT following induction chemo which both had MS of ~16 months but if you look at just the surgical arm, the addition of PORT improved MS by 4 months.
