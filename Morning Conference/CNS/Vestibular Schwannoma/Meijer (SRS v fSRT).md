# study
- 129 pts.
	- Mean 2.5cc.
	- MFU ~3y. 
- Rando
	- SRS:  First  7 pts got 10/1, last 42 pts got 12.5/1.
	- FSRS: First 12 pts got 20/5, last 68 pts got   25/5.

> Perhaps better trigeminal nerve preservation with FSRS. Otherwise, there is no difference between SRS and FSRS.

There was a trend to increased failures for lesions > 1.5 cm treated with SRS (i.e., > 2 cc)

- 136 pts. 1.5 cc. MFU nearly 5y.
- There was borderline significance with cystic tumors and local failure.

| 5y  | 12/1 | 18-21/3 | 25/5 |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ---- |
| LC  | 89   | 97      | 94   |
- A tendency toward higher incidence of local failure was observed after 2015 when SRS treatment increased and included slightly larger tumors. 
- For those with baseline Gardner-Robertson class I/II, hearing preservation ~60-70% for FSRS. 
- Persistent facial or trigeminal nerve toxicity was rare (~2%).
