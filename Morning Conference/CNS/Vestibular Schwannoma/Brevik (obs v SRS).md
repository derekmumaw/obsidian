# study
- 237 pts.
	- MFU 55 mo.
- Intervention
	- GKRS for < 2 cm after growth or >2 cm who refused surgery.
	- Observation
# results

| Results               | Obs | GK  |
| --------------------- | --- | --- |
| Loss of serv. Hearing | 76  | 64  |

- Significant reduction in tumor size and 10x less for future treatment with SRS.
- There was not a difference in symptoms or QoL after SRS.

>[!summary] 
> This study of 240 patients focused mainly on QOL outcomes for GK. They found that SRS does not improve QoL over existing baseline, i.e. it does not "fix" any symptoms. This is similar to the [[Andrews (46.8 v 50.4)]] study where only 20% of patients had symptomatic improvement with conventional fractionation.

# notes
- 11% transient facial numbness, 
- <5% chronic
- most common acute side effect is transient dizziness (treat with steroids)
- can see transient psudoprogression on MRI
- see Fig3.a for size changes.  
- historically, rates of toxicity were higher because they dosed quite a bit higher
- In general, these retrospective studies have crap baseline patient documentation
