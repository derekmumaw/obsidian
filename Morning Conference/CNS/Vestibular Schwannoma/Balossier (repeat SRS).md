> Repeat SRS for Progressive Vestibular Schwannomas after previous SRS [Balossier NS Rev '21](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33847846/).  

>[!intervention] 
> re-SRS
# study
- 8 studies, 194 patients 
- Overall rate of repeat SRS of 2.2%. 
- MTT Re-RT of 51 mo.

# results
- Median marginal dose at first / second SRS of 12→ 12 Gy. 
- After repeat SRS,
	- tumor stability   (30%)
	- tumor decrease    (54%)
	- tumor progression (16%) 
	- Basically the same as [[Maire (EBRT)]]
- Tox
	- New trigeminal numbness in 10%.
	- New facial nerve palsy or worsened in 4%. 
	- Hearing loss in 54% (n=12/22).

>[!summary] 
> Re-SRS is effective (85% with stability or improvement) and reasonably safe though hearing loss is just over 50%.
