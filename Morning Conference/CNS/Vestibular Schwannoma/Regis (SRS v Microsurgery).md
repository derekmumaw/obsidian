> Microsurgery vs. GKRS.  

# study
- 500 pts.
	- Unilateral.
	- Only analyzed Koos grade II and III due to imbalance in other groups.
- Rando:
	- RT
		- 14 Gy  for stage I and small stage II,
		- 12 Gy- for larger tumors.
	- Microsurgery*:
		- Translabyrinthine 85%,
		- MCF               15%
		- \*(when preservation of hearing feasible).
