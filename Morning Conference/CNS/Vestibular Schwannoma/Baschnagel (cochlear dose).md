# Notes
- problems
	- really limits your tumor coverage to meet constraints
- consider dose adjusting based on baseline hearing
	- 13 Gy if they have hearing loss already
	- 12-12.5 if baseline hearing is good/servicable
	- test

- The Effect of Cochlear Dose on Hearing Preservation [Govindaraj ARO '22](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2022.101059): Systematic review.  

- 21 cohort studies and 1 case-control study were included
- SRS dose 11-14 Gy and included adult patients with sporadic VS, initially serviceable hearing, and at least 24 months of mean or median follow up.
- There was substantial heterogeneity between studies in terms of baseline hearing status, cochlear dosimetry, definition and reporting of hearing outcome, and duration of follow-up, precluding formal meta-analysis.
- Based on currently available data, "a practical approach would be to aim for a mean cochlear dose of <4-6 Gy without compromising tumor dose."
