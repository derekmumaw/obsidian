>[!summary] 
> - The DIRECTOR trial is a currently ongoing multicenter PRT comparing 2 different Temodar regimens in recurrent GBM. Those results are still pending but they did take a look at some of the surgical data. 
> - They analyzed 105 patients, 70% of whom underwent resection. There seems to be a pretty dramatic improvement in median survival if MRI shows no residual contrast enhancement. 
> - interestingly, there does not seem to be any effect of surgery itself; the mOS is only about a month longer compared to the patients without surgery at all.
