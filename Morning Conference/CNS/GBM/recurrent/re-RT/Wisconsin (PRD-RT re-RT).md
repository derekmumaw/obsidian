> Pulsed Reduced Dose-rate RT (0.2 Gy x9-10 sFx q3minutes -> 50 Gy)

# study

- 103 patients
	- Recurrent GBM
	- 86 with WHO 4
- Treatment
	- PRD-RT: 0.2Gy x 9-10 with 3 minute intervals
	- Median total of 50Gy (20-60)
# results
- <14 month recurrence: MS 21 weeks
- >14 month recurrence: MS 28 weeks
- MS decreases with tumor grade
- Conclusion
- Safe for large volumes

>[!summary] 
> - Toxicity is the major concern in the setting of reirradiation and, in the confined space of the cranium, toxicity can be lethal. Pulsed reduced dose-rate RT is a technique where low dose pulses of RT are given over a spread out time-period to minimize this toxicity. 
> - Wisconsin studied this technique in 100 patients with large-volume, recurrent GBM. They used 9 or 10 0.2 Gy pulses every 3 minutes up to a median of 50Gy.
> - Results seemed to be primarily dependent on the time to recurrence. If it was quicker than 14 months, then MS was 5 months, but if it was longer than 14 months, then MS was 7 months.
