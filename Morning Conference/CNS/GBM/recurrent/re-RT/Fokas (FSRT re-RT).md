	- 1998-2008. 
	- Median interval to re-tx 12 mo.
# results
- MS 9 mo. 
- 1y PFS 22%. 
- TTP from initial irradiation of 12 mo.
- Only KPS < 70 predicted poor survival. 
- No G2+ acute or late toxicity.

>[!summary] 
> - Fokas led a study of reirradiation with fxSRT in 53 patients with recurrent GBM where they were randomized to re-RT to 30/10. 
> - This showed feasibility of this treatment with MS extending to 9 months and 1y PFS of 22%. It was quite well tolerated with no G2+ acute or late toxicity
