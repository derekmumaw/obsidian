TBL [QS](http://www.quadshotnews.blogspot.com/2022/12/pro-vax.html): An autologous tumor lysate-loaded dendritic cell vaccine (does that term make sense now…?) may improve survival when added to other standard therapies for newly-diagnosed and recurrent GBM.
# study
- 331 pts, 
	- 223 to DCVax-L and 99 to placebo. 
	- Around 2/3rds placebo arm crossed over to vaccine arm at recurrence/progression.
# results
| results | SOC | DCVax |
| ------- | --- | ----- |
| mOS     | 17m | 19m   |
| 2y OS   | 10  | 16    |
| 5y OS   | 6   | 13      |
- DCVax well tolerated, no G4+ toxicity.

>- DCVax is new trial where they took 330 patients with recurrent GBM and randomized them 2:1 to this crazy dendritic cell vaccine or placebo.
