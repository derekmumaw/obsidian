>[!summary] 
>- Role of Bevacizumab with HFRT should be limited to __small volume recurrences__ especially in previously non-irradiated treatment areas __at least 6 mos following completion of previous RT__. 
>- Re-RT is safe and well tolerated, but only leads to an improvement in PFS (not OS).

# study
- 170 pts.
	- Failure ≥ 6 mo after prior RT.
	- Stratification
		- ± 50yo, KPS 70-80/90+, EOR/biopsy.
	- MFU 13 mo.
- RT:
	- T1c/bed + 0 mm*
		- *5 mm allowed for < 3.5 cm lesions or new lesions.
		- PTV V100 ≥ 95-90%.
		- PTV Dmin ≥ 85-80% (29.75-28 Gy).
		- PTV Dmax ≤ 120-130 (42-45.5 Gy). 
	- Normal tissue dose limits
		- Previous RT:
			- OC/ON_PRV_03 20-25 Gy    (0.03cc),
			- Brainstem    24-30 Gy    (0.03cc).
		- No previous RT:
			- OC/ON_PRV_03 35-36.75 Gy (0.03cc),
			- Brainstem    35-36.75 Gy (0.03cc).

|PFS 6mo|29|54|
- G3+ AE in 5% of the RT treatment arm. 
- In the RT arm, 80% re-irradiation. 
	- Median GTV=19cc, and PTV=53cc. 
- Overall treatment per protocol in 60% of the retreatment group (n=38/65) and 70% of the new treatment area group (n=11/16).
^radcrap
- Primary RT protocol deviations include geometric miss, exceeded normal tissue tolerance limits, GTV size, and inadequate treatment volume minimum coverage.

>[!summary]
> - RTOG 1205 tested Bevacizumab with or without RT in 170 patients with recurrent GBM, 80% of whom had been previously irradiated. RT was 35/10 fx. 
> - We only have an abstract and only just over a year of follow up so no overall survival differences have emerged yet, but there was a doubling in mPFS with re-RT.
