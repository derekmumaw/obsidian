>- Roa, like the EORTC trial, also wanted to deintensify treatment for the elderly, though without the added confounder of Temodar.
>- So, he randomized 100 patients older than 60y to 60/30 vs 40/15. No differences were found, other that less need for steroids and higher rates of completion of treatment.
