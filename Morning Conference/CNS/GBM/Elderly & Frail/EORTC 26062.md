>[!rando]
>40.05/15 (2.67) (± TMZ).  

>[!summary]
The most hypofractionated regimen that can be given with TMZ is 40/15!  
# study
- 560 pts.
	- ECOG 0-2. Age ≥ 65y.
	- Strat: Center, KPS, EOR, Age (65-70 / 71-75 / >75y). 
- systemic
	- TMZ 75 mg/m2 Qday during RT→ (1 mo break) 150-200 mg/m2 d1-5 q28d x12c. PCP ppx.
- RT
	- CTV: T1c/bed + 1.5 cm (no mention of edema).
	- PTV: CTV + 0.5 cm.
# results
| Results     | RT only | +TMZ |
| -----------: | ------- | ---- |
| Overall MS  | 7.6     | 9.3  |
| Me'd MS     | 7.7     | 13.5 |
| Non Me'd MS | 8       | 10   |
| PFS         | 3.9     | 5.3  |
    
- Patients ≤ 70y (65-70y) appeared to benefit less.
- No difference in QoL.

>[!summary]
> - Not all patients can tolerate the heavy Stupp regimen and so less intense regimens may be needed for the elderly and frail. 
> - EORTC 26062 recruited 560 patients older than 65. Like EORT 26981, all patients got RT and then were randomized to the addition of concurrent and adjuvant TMZ, but, in this case, the RT was reduced from 60/30 to 40.05/15.
> - Results showed improved MS from 7.6 to 9.3, though, again, this seemed to be driven by the methylated population
