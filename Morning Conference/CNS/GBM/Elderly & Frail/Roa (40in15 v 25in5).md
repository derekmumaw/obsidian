>40/15 vs. 25/5. (no TMZ)  

>[!summary]
>- For poor KPS (50-70%), 25/5 no worse than 40/15.
>- Roa is the only first author with two landmark trials for elderly/frail, this is the only trial including KPS as factor.  
# study
- 98 pts.
	- Frail = ≥ 50y or KPS 50-70%;
	- Elderly ≥ 65 and KPS 80-100%; or
	- both Frail/Elderly. 
- RT
	- CTV: T1/bed + 2 cm (no mention of edema).
	- PTV: CTV + 0.5 cm.
# results
| Results | 40/15 | 25/5 |
| ------- | ----- | ---- |
| MS      | 6.4   | 7.9  |
| PFS     | 4.2   | 4.2  |
- ~QoL at 4 and 8 weeks.
>[!summary]
> - To continue on his results from the 60 vs 40 trial, Roa tried to hypofractionate even further. He randomized 100 patients with either KPS 50-70 or age>65 to 40/15 vs 25/5. 
> - Again, results were no different. Numerically, it seemed even to slightly favor the 25/5
