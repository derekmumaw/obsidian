# study
- 40 patients
	- untreated intracranial glial neoplasm
	- serial stereotactic biopsies
# results
- MR Contrast enhancement = tumor tissue
- CT hypodensity = tumor or edema
- ITCs at least as far as T2 signal
- 80% of cells within 2cm
- some out to 5cm though #yikes

>[!summary] 
>this study is the rationale for how many studies define their targets (boost T1 contrast, treat all T2 signal).
