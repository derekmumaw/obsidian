## Epidemiology
- 30-50% of CNS tumors, or 80% if malignant.
- 10,000 cases per year, or 3-4 cases per 100,000 people. 
	- 40000 primary brain tumors. 
		- 50% benign, 50% malignant -> 25% GBM
- #emph in terms of total years of life lost, it's one of the worst
- Median age 64.
- M:F 1.4:1.
- MS
	- 15m  maximal therapy
	-  3m  without any therapy
	- <3% survive past 5 years.
- focality
	- Multicentric < 5%
	- Multifocal   < 20%. 
	- Positive CSF   10%
## Histology/pathology
![[WHO_grading.png]] 
- IDHmt (WHO 4 diffuse astrocytoma)
- IDHwt (WHO 4 GBM)
- GBM, NOS
- **Grading** (MEAN):
	- **M**itotic index
	- Nuclear **A**typia,
	- **E**ndothelial proliferation, and
	- **N**ecrosis.
	- GBM requires pseudopalisading necrosis or 3+ of above.
 - History
	 - used to just be necrosis
	 - WHO 2000
		 - other histologic features could get you GBM status
	 - WHO 2007
		 - dropped multiforme
	 - WHO 2021
		 - No more Roman numerals
		 - Grading within types
		 - NOS added (no molecular studies available)
		 - NEC added (doesn't fit neatly in existing categories)
## **Workup**
- H&P:
	- HA, N/V, focal neuro deficits, seizure, sx of mass effect.
	- Cushing triad:
		- Hypertension, bradycardia, respiratory irregularity
		- indicative of hydrocephalus.
	- Early morning headaches, seizures are common.
- #emph High likelihood for DVT -> Low threshold for dopplers.
- #emph depression is underdiagnosed in this pop. 
- PE:
	- Neuro exam, CBL signs, fundoscopic exam, KPS.
- Labs:
	- CBC, CMP.
- Imaging
	- CT head, 
	- MRI brain.
		- T1+c enhancing, T2 enhancing, + T2 Flair (edema).
		- Obtain MRI 48-72h after surgery to avoid confounding w subacute blood products.
		- #emph why is the radiographic appearance important to a surgeon?
			- probably didn't get it all out 
				- see [[Mayo (extent of dz)]], [[UTSW (extent of resection)]], [[DIRECTOR (EOR)]]
			- Gotta get the Flair portion of disease. 
	- MR spect 
		- UCSF
			- CNI > 1.8 = cancer
				- Choline:NAA
				- choline = tumor, 
				- NAA     = normal cell
	- MR perfusion
		- Good to assess post treatment changes
- Neurosurgery consult: Resection if possible, If not, bx.
## **Survival groups**/prognosis
- many strides made in the last few decades. 
	- MS still looks bad, but the OS _tail_ is growing and growing
- MS is around 1.5 years overall,
	- cut that in half for recurrence treated with RT (e.g. 35/10, 0-0.5 cm margin) or bevacizumab
	- (exception: TTF alone for recurrence has MS of 6 mo).
	- Caveat: Must be good players. 
		- For poor KPS (e.g. < 70) or elderly, median survival is around 5-9 months for hypofractionated regimens. 
- Improving dramatically in recent years (though still dismal)
- **RPA** [Curran JNCI '93](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8478956) does not incorporate IDH-1 or MGMT. Pre-TMZ era. 
- WHO 4 = Class III-VI
- Most important: 50y, histology (AA or GBM), KPS 70, mental status changes, and symptoms ± 3 mo.

|RPA class|III|IV|V|VI|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|MS|18mo|11mo|9mo|5mo|
- [**Adapted RPA**](onenote:#RTOG - RPA Validation&section-id={AB75B68F-7D99-48ED-B181-47B6D372FCB4}&page-id={C3581F44-F888-4C75-A556-6B05577BB49A}&end&base-path=https://beaumont-my.sharepoint.com/personal/derek_mumaw_beaumont_org/Documents/Derek%20@%20Beaumont%20Health/CNS/GBM.one) accounts for ± TMZ. More commonly used
	- As in RPA, only GBMs < 50y with high KPS have a median survival above one year (e.g. Class III, 18 mo).

## Surgery
- Goals
	- Pathologic diagnosis. 
	- Reduce mass effect, symptoms
	- Decrease need for steroids
	- Decrease tumor burden
- Flair signals are usually huge, precluding GTR.
- Contraindications to GTR: 
	- Eloquent/inaccessible area involved, significant infiltration past midline, periventricular or diffuse lesions, medical comorbidities.

		- ± BCNU (Carmustine) {± RT}.
		- One of the only positive trials before Stupp.  
		- 222 pt
			- HGG, 90% GBM. 
			- Surgery. 
		- 50 Gy whole brain→ boost to 60 Gy.
		- MS for obs / BCNU only / RT with or without BCNU of 3.2→ 4.2 → ~8m.
	- BTSG [Walker IJROBP '79](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0360301679905534?via%3Dihub). 
 
| WBRT dose | 45  | 50  | 55  | 60  |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MS   | 4   | 7   | 9   | 10    |
		- 60 Gy has the best MS.
- Stupp
	- 60 Gy to T1c/bed + 2 cm,
	- 46 Gy to T2E + 2 cm.
	- 6-12 mos adjuvant TMZ.
- Unmethylated: fail in field 90% of the time, 
-         Me'd: fail in field 2/3 of the time 
	- (more OOF failures with Me'd).
- The most hypofractionated regimen given with concurrent TMZ is 40/15.

### how do we improve RT results?
- __Dose escalation__
	- Most failures are in-field
	- RTOG 7401
		- up to 70
	- UofM
		- up to 90 #yikes 
	- So far, no improvement beyond 60 Gy (some detriment due to tox)
	- Now we have better imaging technology, so we can better identify areas to boost?
	 
- __HyperFx/AcceleratedFx__
	- No survival benefit
 
- __SRS__
	- RTOG 9305
		- upfront SRS boost
		- negative :/
	- RTOG 0023
		- negative :/
  
- __Brachytherapy__
	- Also mostly negative :/
	- Gliasite
		- I-125
		- negative :/
	- Gamma tile 
		- still waiting for results. Intresting concept though. 
### Fields
- lots of options: ABTC, EORTC, CNNTG/Alliance, RTOG/NRG
	- EORTC does not include FLAIR specifically. 
	- ABTC uses just 5mm expansions
- follow NRG guidelines
	- 46 -> T2  +2cm
	- 60 -> T1c +2cm
- Why 2cm? 
	- [[Mayo (extent of dz)]] suggests that 80% of cells within 2cm. (but out to 5cm)
- Dose constraints
	- basically all DMax, so DVH isn't really that important
	- brainstem, optics. 
## Elderly
- basically half of all patients with GBM
- [[EORTC 26062]]
	- somewhat odd dose-fx (2.67/d)

## Systemics
- initial failures
	- nitrosoureas 
		- BTSG 69-01, 72-01, 74-01
			- only ever showed a trend
		- Metanalysis showed a slight benefit for a subpopulation...
	- RTOG series:
		- 9417, 9513, 9602, 9710, etc. 
		- all basically negative
- Temozolomide (TMZ)
	- 2nd gen alkylating agent
	- initially developed for melanoma
	- #pimp dose (per [[EF-14 (stupp ± TTF)]]): 
		- 75 concurrently
		- 150-200 d1-5 q28d adjuvantly x6-12c.
	- Consider TMZ alone for Me'd elderly or frail.
	- Early pseudo-progression is very common. 
		- MR perfusion helpful in differentiating. Ideally, you'd also have a pre-RT scan.
		- MR spect also helpful, but less good for screening (limited area of scan)
	- MGMT
		- _methylation_ of the promoter 
		- unmethylated tumors tend to be able to blunt effects of TMZ 
		- therefore, methylated patients have better prognosis
- Avastin (Bev)
	- Initial trials showed amazing results
		- when you recurred though, you did very poorly
	- #pimp Avastin just decreased __enhancement__. 
	- Has no effect on tumor, so no real change in outcomes. 
		- just delays __visibility__ of progression, not progression itself.
	- Does improve QOL: (still has a place)
		- decreases need for steroids, improves symptoms 
- Others
	- Lomustine:
		- Adding lomustine (not intensified dose) to methylated tumors appears to extend OS by 7 mo (controversial), but even standard dosing is toxic.
	- immunotherapy 
		- Nivolumab (CheckMate 143 #todo add link)
		- poor results
			- GMB doesn't have T-cells in the microenvironment (blood-brain barrier). Immunotherapies target T-cells
			- Maybe we need to target the M2 cells			- 
	- [[others]]
		- Intra-tumoral poliovirus 
		- Toga-511 (local 5-FU) 
		- may have durable responses
			- controversial.
			- 
 - TTF
	 - de novo[[EF-14 (stupp ± TTF)]], 
	 - recurrence [[EF-11 (TTF v chemo)]]
## Recurrence
- 35/10 to T1c, no margin common (last line tx).
-  MS typically 9 mo.
- #todo consolidate recurrence sections here
- can treat with GK.
- Fogh: 35 Gy
- Sahebjam: hypoFx RT + pembro + Avastin

# why do we fail?
- blood brain barrier
	- phase 0 studies
		- treat patient -> surgery -> see if drug has penetrance in tumor
- Preclinical models: need to use them
	- IDO inhibitors
		- probably effects M2 macrophages
		- no activity by itself, but with RT, very promising effects. 
		- dropped prematurely
	- NMDAR/PPARgamma
- intratumoral heterogeneity
	- variation in tumor is much more dependent upon location in tumor (central, edge) than upon patient-to-patient difference
		- crazy!
		- this suggests that the tumor evolution/biology is more predictable than we had expected
	- target the leading edge (most aggressive part) for biopsies
- Metabolism
	- GBMs use lipids as a major energy source (most tumors use glucose)
	- Gain of function
	- Ketogenic diet may actually have some effect
		- especially in combination with RT
		- theory:
			- tumor "evolved" with normal diet. When you switch to Ketogenic, lipids accumulate in tumor cells. Lipids are toxic.
