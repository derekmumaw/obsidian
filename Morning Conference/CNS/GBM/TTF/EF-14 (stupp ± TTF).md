>[!rando] 
>Stupp→ TMZ {± TTF}

>[!summary] 
>- TTF adds 5 mo to OS! But, need to wear it for 18h/d.  
>- Take-home: OS HR 0.63 for addition of TTF, same as for addition of TMZ to Stupp.

>[!warning]
>- Not double-blinded as placebo didn't have a helmet.
>- Randomization occurred after completion of CCRT.
>- Increased support of TTF patients. Financial support to many study investigators.

| results  | RT/TMZ |  TTF |
| -------- | ------:| ----:|
| MS       |     16 | 20.9 |
| --Me'd   |     21 | 31.6 |
| --unMe'd |   14.7 | 16.9 |
| MPFS     |      4 |  6.7 |
| 2y OS    |     31 |   43 |
| 3y OS    |     16 |   26 |
| 5y OS    |      5 |   13 |
- impressively, survival times measured from completion of Stupp.
- Around 50% will have skin toxicity.
- HR-QOL [Taphoorn JAMA Onc '18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29392280): 
	- Itchy skin was worse.
 
>[!summary]
>- Stupp 2 tested the addition of tumor treating fields to the classic stupp RT + concurrent and adjuvant Temodar.
>- The results showed a clear benefit to TTF with a 5 month MS advantage from 16 to 21 months, again, this is being driven by the methylated subset. 
>- This is basically as big a benefit that Temodar added
>- However, it wasn't blinded and the TTF patients got coddled with a bunch of extra support while the non-TTF patients were just sorta left out to dry.

>[!PC]
> - huge trial, tough to argue with the results
> - 1.5x better improvement that what TMZ adds #todo add reference in here
