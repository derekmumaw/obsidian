# Abstract
READNEED research was concerned with the development of methodologies for determining reading requirements of Army Military Occupational Specialties (MOSs). Three approaches for assessing MOS literacy demands are described: (a) analysis of readability of Army MOS materials using a newly developed readability formula calibrated on Army personnel and Army job materials; (b) use of information currently in Army data banks to study relationships between reading ability (estimated from AFQT) and job proficiency (indexed by the Primary Military Occupational Specialty/Evaluation Test); and (c) direct assessment of personnel reading skills in relation to proficiency on specially constructed Job Reading Task Tests (JRTT). Feasibility studies that indicate the relative merits of each approach, and certain conceptual and operational problems in determining literacy requirements of jobs are described. (Author)
