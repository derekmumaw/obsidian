  abstract = {PURPOSE: In this study, the dosimetric accuracy of analytical anisotropic algorithm (AAA) and Acuros XB (AXB) dose calculation algorithms (Varian Medical  Systems, Palo Alto, CA) was investigated for small radiation fields incident on  phantoms of various metals that include stainless steel grade 316L (SS316L) and  titanium alloy grade 5 (Ti5) implants. In addition, the effects of using metal  artifact reduction for orthopedic implants (O-MAR, Philips Healthcare, Cleveland,  OH) were evaluated. METHODS: The evaluations of AAA and AXB were performed by  comparing the crossline profiles calculated by AAA and AXB with GafChromic(TM)  EBT3 film measurements at the phantom-implant interfaces and in close vicinity of  implant materials for small field sizes (1~×~1~cm(2) , 2~×~2~cm(2) , 3~×~3~cm(2)  , and 4~×~4~cm(2) ) of a 6~MV flattening filter free photon beam. O-MAR corrected  and uncorrected (UC) computed tomography (CT) images were used for dose  calculations. The values of average and standard deviations (SD) of Hounsfield  unit (HU) for selected regions of each case were evaluated. The differences in  average dose percentages in defined regions were calculated to quantify the  relative dosimetric changes between doses calculated on UC and O-MAR corrected CT  images. RESULTS: Compared to UC images, the values of SD were reduced, and the  average HU became closer to its reference value in the O-MAR images. There was  some discrepancy in average dose percentage differences between calculations  using UC and O-MAR images at 1~cm above the SS316L implant (average dose  percentage differences were AXB/UC~=~5.9\% and AXB/O-MAR~=~-1.2\%; AAA/UC~=~2.2\%,  and AAA/O-MAR~=~-0.8\%). Neither AAA nor AXB algorithms predict increase in dose  at upper phantom-implant interface (4.9\%, 9.9\%. 13.5\%, and 13.8\% for the fields  from 1~×~1~cm(2) to 4~×~4~cm(2) , respectively). At the side of the SS316L  implant (where dark streak artifacts exist), dose difference averages were  estimated as~-~1.1\% and 22.3\% when AXB/O-MAR and AXB/UC calculations are compared  with EBT3 measurements, respectively. Dose predictions at 1~cm below the SS316L  implant were underestimated by AXB/O-MAR (average -0.5\%) and AXB/UC (average  2.0\%). CONCLUSIONS: The O-MAR tool was shown to have a favorable dosimetric  effect or no effect on the calculations in the upper proximity of the implant  materials. The dose differences between EBT3 film measurements and calculations  at upper phantom-implant interfaces were smaller when they were calculated using  O-MAR images. However, the dose differences increased when O-MAR corrected images  were used for AAA calculations at lower phantom-implant interfaces. Use of O-MAR  enabled closer agreement for the AXB algorithm, especially in the dark streak  artifact regions. The O-MAR algorithm should be used when the dose is calculated  with the AXB algorithm in cases of patients with the metal implants. The  estimations using AAA and AXB algorithms, in phantom setups, with Ti5 implant  material were found to be closer to the EBT3 film measurements, when compared  with the same estimations using SS316L implant material.},

  abstract = {AIM OF THE STUDY: Some cancerous patients have hip prosthesis of metal elements when they undergo radiation therapy. Metal implants are a cause of metal  artifacts in computed tomography (CT) images due to their higher density compared  to normal tissues. The aim of this study is to evaluate the quantitative effects  of metal artifacts on dose distribution of the pelvic region. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: Seven patients with metal implants in the pelvic region were scanned and  CT images were exported to the Monaco treatment planning system. Based on the  diagnosis of each patient, three-dimensional plans were implemented on CT images  and dose distributions were extracted. At the next step, metal artifacts were  contoured and electron densities of these new structures were modified to the  extent of soft tissue. Finally, dose distributions and the differences were  investigated by VeriSoft software. RESULTS: The results of this study showed that  if the electron density to metal artifacts is not assigned properly, it will  increase the calculated monitor units (MUs) by almost 3.78 MUs/fraction which  will significantly affect total dose distribution of treatment. CONCLUSION: For  the precise implementation of the treatment and in order to minimize the  systematic errors related to the calculated MUs, necessary corrections on the  electron density of metal artifacts should be considered before the treatment  planning. The issue will be more critical in advanced treatment modalities where  dose escalation is needed.},

Our inclusion criteria were cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract; treatment with radiation, chemotherapy, and/or surgery; and a maximal incisal opening (MIO) of less than 30 mm. MIO and the rate of improvement of trismus (“gain”) were measured at selected intervals. Twenty-six patients met our study criteria; their pretherapy mean MIO was 19.3 mm. At the time of their most recent measurement, the mean MIO had increased to 25.5 mm—a measured gain of 32\%. Although the initial rate of gain was 0.36 mm/day during the first 6 weeks, improvement leveled off over time, and the overall rate of gain was 0.16 mm/day. We conclude that the DTS is effective in increasing the mandibular range of motion at a rate of change that is maximized during initial treatment.},

  abstract = {Radiation-induced trismus has a significant impact on the quality of life of patients receiving radiotherapy for head and neck cancers. Pentoxifylline has immunomodulatory activities that downregulate certain cytokines that have been implicated as mediators of fibrogenic reactions after radiation. A pilot study was therefore conducted to evaluate the efficacy of pentoxifylline in the treatment of radiation-induced trismus. Twenty patients with severe trismus (dental gap ≤ 25 mm) after receiving radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma were enrolled onto the study. Four patients were excluded from analysis because of poor drug compliance. The remaining 16 evaluable patients completed an 8-week course of pentoxifylline at a dose of 400 mg two to three times daily. Changes in dental gap were recorded by measuring the distance between left upper and lower incisor before and after treatment. At the end of treatment, 10 patients had a measured increase in dental gap ranging from 2 to 25 mm. Six patients had an increment of 5 mm or more. The mean dental gap before treatment was 12.5 mm compared with 16.5 mm at the end of treatment (p = 0.023). The mean difference in dental gap was 4 mm, with a 95\% confidence interval of 0.6 to 7.4 mm. The drug pentoxifylline appears to exert a modest therapeutic effect in patients with radiation-induced trismus, although our findings need to be confirmed by a randomized placebo-controlled study. While awaiting more evidence from clinical studies, a therapeutic trial of pentoxifylline is worth considering in patients experiencing radiation-induced trismus.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of hip prostheses is increasing. Prostate radiation delivery in the setting of hip prostheses is complicated by both imaging artifacts that  interfere with volume delineation and dosimetric effects that must be addressed  in the planning process. We hypothesized that with specialized planning, any  photon-based definitive prostate radiotherapy approach may be utilized in  patients with bilateral hip prostheses. Imaging data from sequential patients  with prostate cancer and bilateral hip prostheses treated definitively with  radiation were retrospectively reviewed. Bimodality imaging was used to define  targets and organs at risk (OARs) along with specialized MRI sequences and/or  orthopedic metal artifact reduction (OMAR) for MRI and CT artifact suppression,  respectively. Multiple VMAT plans were generated for each set of patient images  to include three fractionation schemes (conventional, hypofractionated, and  SBRT), each with hip avoidance and with simulated normal hip. The ability to meet  standard dose constraints was assessed for each plan type. Differences in target  and OAR dosing between plans accounting for prosthetic hips via avoidance vs  plans with simulated absence of prosthetic hip were also assessed. T-tests were  used to compare dosimetric parameters. Ten patients with bilateral hip prostheses  were identified, and 6 plans were created for each patient for a total of 60  radiation plans. Prosthetic hip avoidance did not result in failure to meet dose  constraints for any patient. Hip avoidance resulted in minimal increases in high  dose to the rectum and bladder (increases in mean V80\%, V90\%, and V95\% ranged  from 0.1\% to 2.4\%). Larger increases were seen at lower dose levels, with rectal  V50\% significantly increased in all three plan types with hip avoidance  (conventional: 26.0\% [standard deviation, SD 13.9] vs 16.9\% [SD 10.2, p\,=\,0.003];  hypofractionation: 26.4\% [SD 13.3] vs 17.1\% [SD 10.1, p\,=\,0.002]; SBRT: 18.3\% [SD  10.7] vs 10.5\% [SD 6.9, p\,=\,0.008]). Similarly, hip avoidance resulted in  increases in bladder V50\% to 31.7\% (SD 16.8) vs 23.3\% (SD 14.0, p\,=\,0.001), 31.3\%  (SD 17.0) vs 23.3\% (SD 13.8, p\,=\,0.002), and 22.7\% (SD 12.3) vs 16.5\% (SD 12.6, p  {$<$} 0.001) for conventional, hypofractionated, and SBRT plans, respectively.  Hydrogel spacer resulted in reductions in rectal dose. For example, V70\% for hip  avoidance plans decreased with spacer presence to 8.3\% (SD 6.7) vs 21.1\% (SD 5.8,  p\,=\,0.021), 8.6\% (SD 6.5) vs 21\% (SD 5.7, p\,=\,0.022), and 3.7\% (SD 3.2) vs 15\%  (SD 8.2, p\,=\,0.010) for conventional, hypofractionated, and SBRT plans,  respectively. Any photon-based definitive prostate radiotherapy approach can be  used with bimodality imaging for target and OAR definition and planning  techniques to avoid dose attenuation effects of hip prostheses. Hydrogel spacer  is a useful adjunct.},

  abstract = {Purpose Radiotherapy (XRT) for spine sarcomas is constrained by spinal cord, nerve, and viscera tolerance. Negative surgical margins are uncommon; hence, doses of ≥ 66 Gy are recommended. A Phase II clinical trial evaluated high dose photon/proton XRT for spine sarcomas. Materials/Methods Eligible patients had non-metastatic, thoracic, lumbar, and/or sacral spine/paraspinal sarcomas. Treatment included pre- and/or post-op photon/proton XRT +/- radical resection; patients with osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma received chemotherapy. Shrinking fields delivered 50.4 cobalt Gray equivalent (GyRBE) to subclinical disease, 70.2 GyRBE to microscopic disease in the tumor bed, and 77.4 GyRBE to gross disease at 1.8 GyRBE q.d. Doses were reduced for radiosensitive histologies, concurrent chemoradiation, or when diabetes or autoimmune disease present. Spinal cord dose was limited to 63/54 GyRBE to surface/center. Intra-operative boost doses of 7.5-10 Gy could be given by dural plaque. Results 50 patients (29 chordoma, 14 chondrosarcoma, 7 other) underwent gross total (n=25) or subtotal (n=12) resection or biopsy (n=13). With 48 month median follow-up, five-year actuarial local control, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival are: 78\%, 63\%, and 87\% respectively. Two of 36 (5.6\%) patients treated for primary versus 7/14 (50\%) for recurrent tumor developed local recurrence, p{$<$}0.001. Five patients developed late radiation-associated complications; no myelopathy developed but three sacral neuropathies appeared following 77.12-77.4 GyRBE. Conclusions Local control with this treatment is high in patients radiated at the time of primary presentation. Spinal cord dose constraints appear to be safe. Sacral nerves receiving 77.12-77.4 GyRBE are at risk for late toxicity.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Impending and actual pathologic fractures secondary to metastatic bone disease, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma often require intramedullary fixation  followed by radiation therapy. Because of carbon's low atomic number, there are  reduced computed tomography (CT) imaging artifacts and dose perturbation when  planning postoperative radiation for carbon fiber (CF) rods. Herein, we  characterize the dosimetric properties of CF implants compared with titanium  alloy (TA) for proton and photon. METHODS AND MATERIALS: TA and CF samples were  acquired from an implant manufacturer. Material characteristics were evaluated by  CT scans with and without metal artifact reduction (MAR). Relative stopping power  (RSP) was determined from the range pull-back of each sample in a 20-cm range  proton beam. Photon transmission measurements were made in a solid water phantom  and compared with the modeled dosimetry from the RayStation planning system.  RESULTS: CF caused no visible CT artifacts, and MAR was not necessary for  Hounsfield unit (HU) determination (median, 364 HU) or contouring, whereas TA  (median, 3071 HU) caused substantial artifacts, which were improved, but not  eliminated by MAR. The proton RSP was measured as 3.204 for TA and 1.414 for CF.  For 6 MV photons, the measured transmission was 89.3\% for TA and 98\% for CF. CF  RSP calculation and transmission from CT HU showed a physical density  overestimate compared with measurements, which would cause a slight, but  acceptable, dose uncertainty ({$<$}10\% proton range or 1\% photon transmission).  CONCLUSIONS: With a density similar to bone, CF implants did not cause imaging  artifacts and minimal dose perturbation compared with TA. Although the CF proton  RSP is underestimated and the photon attenuation is overestimated by the HU, both  effects are relatively small and may be most easily accounted for by planning  with a 2-mm expansion around organs at risk beyond or in close proximity to the  implant.},

Three different four-field plans have then been applied: a  Single-Field-Uniform-Dose (SFUD) plan, both with and without artifact correction  implemented, and an Intensity-Modulated-Proton-Therapy (IMPT) plan with the  artifacts corrected. For corrections, the artifacts were manually outlined and  the Hounsfield Units manually set to an average value for soft tissue. Results  show a surprisingly good agreement between prescribed and delivered dose  distributions when artifacts have been corrected, with {$>$} 97\% and 98\% of points  fulfilling the gamma criterion of 3\%/3 mm for both SFUD and the IMPT plans,  respectively. In contrast, without artifact corrections, up to 18\% of measured  points fail the gamma criterion of 3\%/3 mm for the SFUD plan. These measurements  indicate that correcting manually for the reconstruction artifacts resulting from  metal implants substantially improves the accuracy of the calculated dose  distribution.},

In total, 89 patients (13 dentate, 30 partially dentate and 46 edentulous) treated for cancer of the oral cavity or oropharynx were asked whether they experienced a limited mouth opening. The mandibular function impairment questionnaire (MFIQ) was filled out and mouth opening was measured. The proportion correctly predicted (proportion true positives+proportion true negatives) was calculated. For cut-off points from 25 to 45mm, differences in MFIQ scores of the restricted and non-restricted groups were analyzed. A receiver operating curve was constructed. The proportion correctly predicted was highest for cut-off point ≤35mm (0.81), with a sensitivity of 0.71 and a specificity of 0.98. Differences in perceived mandibular function impairments were significant for all cut-off points of 35mm or less. For the total group, the area under curve was 0.87. For the subgroups of dentate, partially dentate and edentulous patients, no consistent cut-off points could be found on the basis of the proportion correctly predicted and the significance of the difference in MFIQ scores. A mouth opening of ≤35mm is a functional cut-off point for trismus in head and neck oncology patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an extremely challenging neurological disease for which the development of more effective therapeutic options and of adjuvant/complementary treatment is needed. We investigated the effects of an innovative phytosome-based delivery form of boswellic acids extract (Monoselect AKBA™) on radiochemotherapy-induced cerebral edema in patients with primary GBM. METHODS: Patients with de novo GBM treated with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide were enrolled in this longitudinal study and received boswellia-based product 4500 mg/die for a maximum of 34 weeks. Cerebral edema was assessed at 4, 12, 22 and 34 weeks post-surgery, together with steroids consumption and patients' psychological status. RESULTS: A total of 20 patients were included in the study. The percentage of patients with reduced edema was constant during the study, while the percentage of those with reduced or stable edema tended to increase over time. Of note, two patients achieved a considerable reduction in brain edema, which led to a more favorable and beneficial surgical resection. In addition, a good percentage of patients assumed a stable/reduced steroids dose or were dexamethasone free during the study. Lastly, patients' QoL and psychological state were maintained throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS: Complementary treatment with Monoselect AKBA™ might exert a beneficial effect in reducing radiochemotherapy-induced cerebral edema, thanks to the anti-inflammatory properties of the boswellia serrata extract. The reduction in brain edema might diminish dexamethasone assumption, thus minimizing steroids-induced side effects, and in few cases may allow a complete surgical excision of the tumor mass.},

  abstract = {Background Patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are at high risk for brain metastases. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is recommended in this population to reduce the incidence of brain metastases and prolong survival. We aimed to assesses the efficacy of PCI in this population in the era of routine brain imaging. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the use among patients who were radiographically confirmed not to have brain metastases after completion of first-line therapy. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, cohort studies and controlled trials reporting on the use of PCI for patients SCLC were identified in EMBASE, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and grey literature sources. The literature search was conducted on November 12, 2023. Summary data were extracted. Random-effects meta-analyses pooled hazard ratios (HR) for the primary outcome of overall survival between PCI and no intervention groups. This study is registered with the Open Science Framework, DOI:10.17605/OSF.IO/BC359, and PROSPERO, CRD42021249466. Findings Of 4318 identified records, 223 were eligible for inclusion. 109 reported on overall survival in formats amenable to meta-analysis; PCI was associated with longer survival in all patients with SCLC (HR 0.59; 95\% CI, 0.55–0.63; p~{$<~$}0.001; n~=~56,770 patients), patients with limited stage disease (HR 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.55–0.65; p~{$<~$}0.001; n~=~78 studies; n~=~27,137 patients), and patients with extensive stage disease (HR 0.59; 95\% CI, 0.51–0.70; p~{$<~$}0.001; n~=~28 studies; n~=~26,467 patients). Between-study heterogeneity was significant when pooled amongst all studies (I2~=~73.6\%; 95\% CI 68.4\%–77.9\%). Subgroup analysis did not reveal sources of heterogeneity. In a subgroup analysis on studies that used magnetic resonance imaging to exclude presence of brain metastases at restaging among all patients, overall survival did not differ significantly between patients who did or did not receive PCI (HR 0.74; 95\% CI, 0.52–1.05; p~=~0.08; n~=~9 studies; n~=~1384 patients). Interpretation Our findings suggested that administration of PCI is associated with a survival benefit, but not when considering studies that radiographically confirmed absence of brain metastases, suggesting that the survival benefit conferred by PCI might be therapeutic rather than prophylactic.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this clinical trial was to compare efficacy and safety of the Boswellia serrata extract H15 with mesalazine for the treatment of active Crohn's disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Randomised, double-blind, verum-controlled, parallel group comparison for which 102 Patients were randomised. The per protocol population included 44 patients treated with H15 and 39 patients treated with mesalazine. As primary outcome measure the change of the Crohn Disease Activity Index (CDAI) between the status of enrolment and end of therapy was chosen. H 15 was tested on non-inferiority compared to standard treatment with mesalazine. RESULTS: The CDAI between the status of enrolment and end of therapy after treatment with H15 was reduced by 90 and after therapy with mesalazine by 53 scores in the mean. In this non-inferiority-trial the test hypothesis was confirmed by the statistical analysis. The difference between both treatments could not be proven to be statistically significant in favor to H15 for the primary outcome measure. The secondary efficacy endpoints confirm the assessment of the comparison of H15 and mesalazine. The proven tolerability of H15 completes the results of the shown clinical efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms that therapy with H15 is not inferior to mesalazine. This can be interpreted as evidence for the efficacy of H15 according to the state of art in the treatment of active Crohn's disease with Boswellia serrata extract, since the efficacy of mesalazine for this indication has been approved by the health authorities. Considering both safety and efficacy of Boswellia serrata extract H15 it appears to be superior over mesalazine in terms of a benefit-risk-evaluation.},

  abstract = {A significant and increasing number of patients receiving radiation therapy present with metal objects close to, or even within, the treatment area,  resulting in artifacts in computed tomography (CT) imaging, which is the most  commonly used imaging method for treatment planning in radiation therapy. In the  presence of metal implants, such as dental fillings in treatment of head-and-neck  tumors, spinal stabilization implants in spinal or paraspinal treatment or hip  replacements in prostate cancer treatments, the extreme photon absorption by the  metal object leads to prominent image artifacts. Although current CT scanners  include a series of correction steps for beam hardening, scattered radiation and  noisy measurements, when metal implants exist within or close to the treatment  area, these corrections do not suffice. CT metal artifacts affect negatively the  treatment planning of radiation therapy either by causing difficulties to  delineate the target volume or by reducing the dose calculation accuracy. Various  metal artifact reduction (MAR) methods have been explored in terms of improvement  of organ delineation and dose calculation in radiation therapy treatment  planning, depending on the type of radiation treatment and location of the metal  implant and treatment site. Including a brief description of the available CT MAR  methods that have been applied in radiation therapy, this article attempts to  provide a comprehensive review on the dosimetric effect of the presence of CT  metal artifacts in treatment planning, as reported in the literature, and the  potential improvement suggested by different MAR approaches. The impact of  artifacts on the treatment planning and delivery accuracy is discussed in the  context of different modalities, such as photon external beam, brachytherapy and  particle therapy, as well as by type and location of metal implants.},

Recent investigations have revealed that metallic fiducial markers can cause severe perturbations in dose distributions for proton therapy, suggesting smaller markers should be considered. The objective of this study was to estimate the dosimetric impact of small gold markers in patients receiving proton therapy for prostate cancer. Small, medium, and large helical wire markers with lengths of 10 mm and helix diameters of 0.35 mm, 0.75 mm, and 1.15 mm, respectively, were implanted in an anthropomorphic phantom. Radiographic visibility was confirmed using a kilovoltage x‐ray imaging system, and dose perturbations were predicted from Monte Carlo simulations and confirmed by measurements. Monte Carlo simulations indicated that size of dose perturbation depended on marker size, orientation, and distance from the beam's end of range. Specifically, the perturbation of proton dose for the lateral‐opposed‐pair treatment technique was 31\% for large markers and 23\% for medium markers in a typical oblique orientation. Results for perpendicular and parallel orientations were respectively lower and higher. Consequently, these markers are not well suited for use in patients receiving proton therapy for prostate cancer. Dose perturbation was not observed for the small markers, but these markers were deemed too fragile for transrectal implantation in the prostate., PACS number: 87.53.Pb},

CT images  of patients having metal implants undergo image quality deterioration and show  inaccurate HU values due to various artifacts. Metal artifact reduction (MAR) is  used to improve the image quality. In this study, four treatment planning methods  with and without MAR, in combination with actual and assigned HU values, were  analyzed for dose calculation accuracy. The aim was to study the effects of metal  implants on planning CT and to evaluate the dose calculation accuracy of four  treatment planning methods for radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two phantoms  with six different metal inserts were scanned in the extended HU mode, with and  without MAR. Geometry verification and HU analysis of the metals and the  surrounding region were carried out. Water equivalent distance (WED) measurements  and dose calculation for each metal insert were done in the treatment planning  system (TPS) using the anisotropic analytical algorithm (AAA). Point dose and  two-dimensional dose distribution were studied. Percentage variation analysis  between calculated and measured doses and gamma evaluation were conducted to  determine the most suitable method for treatment planning. CONCLUSION: This study  concludes that an MARCT image with an assigned HU similar to that of the metal  implant is better for contouring and high dose calculation accuracy. If MAR is  not available, the actual HU value from the extended HU CT for the metal should  be used for dose calculation.},

Population-based estimates of the prevalence of bone metastases associated with solid tumors, and current treatment patterns for these patients, are limited. This study was undertaken to estimate the prevalence of bone metastases from solid tumors and to describe recent trends in the use of BTA in the US. Methods We estimated the prevalence of bone metastases in the US in 2012 using data from Medicare fee-for-service and PharMetrics Plus, a large commercial claims database. We evaluated the proportion of patients with bone metastases who were treated with BTA in 2012, timing of initiation of BTA relative to bone metastasis diagnosis, and persistence on BTA, overall and by primary tumor type and treatment. Results There were \textasciitilde 330,000 (168,063 Medicare fee-for-service; 162,239 other) patients aged ≥18 years living with solid tumors and bone metastases in 2012. BTA were used by 43\% (Commercial) to 47\% (Medicare) of patients in 2012, with the greatest use among breast cancer patients. Over half (Medicare: 57\%; Commercial: 53\%) of BTA-treated patients initiated BTA after experiencing a bone complication. Conclusion Of the estimated 330,000 solid tumor patients living with bone metastases in the US in 2012, many may have received less than optimal care to prevent bone complications during the calendar year.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Dose calculation errors near metal implants are caused by limitations of the dose calculation algorithm in modeling tissue/metal interface effects as well  as density assignment errors caused by imaging artifacts. The purpose of this  study was to investigate two strategies for reducing dose calculation errors near  metal implants: implementation of metal-based energy deposition kernels in the  convolution/superposition (C/S) dose calculation method and use of metal artifact  reduction methods for computed tomography (CT) imaging. METHODS: Both error  reduction strategies were investigated using a simple geometric slab phantom with  a rectangular metal insert (composed of titanium or Cerrobend), as well as two  anthropomorphic phantoms (one with spinal hardware and one with dental fillings),  designed to mimic relevant clinical scenarios. To assess the dosimetric impact of  metal kernels, the authors implemented titanium and silver kernels in a  commercial collapsed cone C/S algorithm. To assess the impact of CT metal  artifact reduction methods, the authors performed dose calculations using  baseline imaging techniques (uncorrected 120 kVp imaging) and three commercial  metal artifact reduction methods: Philips Healthcare's o-mar, GE Healthcare's  monochromatic gemstone spectral imaging (gsi) using dual-energy CT, and gsi with  metal artifact reduction software (mars) applied. For the simple geometric  phantom, radiochromic film was used to measure dose upstream and downstream of  metal inserts. For the anthropomorphic phantoms, ion chambers and radiochromic  film were used to quantify the benefit of the error reduction strategies.  RESULTS: Metal kernels did not universally improve accuracy but rather resulted  in better accuracy upstream of metal implants and decreased accuracy directly  downstream. For the clinical cases (spinal hardware and dental fillings), metal  kernels had very little impact on the dose calculation accuracy ({$<$}1.0\%). Of the  commercial CT artifact reduction methods investigated, the authors found that  o-mar was the most consistent method, resulting in either improved dose  calculation accuracy (dental case) or little impact on calculation accuracy  (spine case). gsi was unsuccessful at reducing the severe artifacts caused by  dental fillings and had very little impact on calculation accuracy. gsi with mars  on the other hand gave mixed results, sometimes introducing metal distortion and  increasing calculation errors (titanium rectangular implant and titanium spinal  hardware) but other times very successfully reducing artifacts (Cerrobend  rectangular implant and dental fillings). CONCLUSIONS: Though successful at  improving dose calculation accuracy upstream of metal implants, metal kernels  were not found to substantially improve accuracy for clinical cases. Of the  commercial artifact reduction methods investigated, o-mar was found to be the  most consistent candidate for all-purpose CT simulation imaging. The mars  algorithm for gsi should be used with caution for titanium implants, larger  implants, and implants located near heterogeneities as it can distort the size  and shape of implants and increase calculation errors.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of dose perturbations for two metallic spinal screw implants in proton beam therapy in the perpendicular  and parallel beam geometry. A 5.5 mm (diameter) by 45 mm (length) stainless steel  (SS) screw and a 5.5 mm by 35 mm titanium (Ti) screw commonly used for spinal  fixation were CT-scanned in a hybrid phantom of water and solid water. The CT  data were processed with an orthopedic metal artifact reduction (O-MAR)  algorithm. Treatment plans were generated for each metal screw with a proton beam  oriented, first parallel and then perpendicular, to the longitudinal axis of the  screw. The calculated dose profiles were compared with measured results from a  plane-parallel ion chamber and Gafchromic EBT2 films. For the perpendicular  setup, the measured dose immediately downstream from the screw exhibited dose  enhancement up to 12\% for SS and 8\% for Ti, respectively, but such dose  perturbation was not observed outside the lateral edges of the screws. The TPS  showed 5\% and 2\% dose reductions immediately at the interface for the SS nd Ti  screws, respectively, and up to 9\% dose enhancements within 1 cm outside of the  lateral edges of the screws. The measured dose enhancement was only observed  within 5 mm from the interface along the beam path. At deeper depths, the lateral  dose profiles appeared to be similar between the measurement and TPS, with dose  reduction in the screw shadow region and dose enhancement within 1-2 cm outside  of the lateral edges of the metals. For the parallel setup, no significant dose  perturbation was detected at lateral distance beyond 3 mm away from both screws.  Significant dose discrepancies exist between TPS calculations and ion chamber and  film measurements in close proximity of high-Z inhomogeneities. The observed dose  enhancement effect with proton therapy is not correctly modeled by TPS. An extra  measure of caution should be taken when evaluating dosimetry with spinal metallic  implants.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dorsal instrumentation and decompression are the mainstays of spinal tumor treatment. Replacing titanium screws with carbon fiber-reinforced  polyetheretherketone (CFRP) screws can reduce imaging artifacts on neural  structures and perturbations of radiation dose. Further reduction of metal  content in such screws might enhance the benefit. The aim of this study was to  assess the artifacts produced by all-titanium screws (Ti-Ti), CFRP  thread-titanium screw heads (C-Ti), and all-CFRP screws (C-C). METHODS: A  cadaveric spine was used to place Ti-Ti, C-Ti, and C-C consecutively from T2 to  S1. Computed tomography and 1.5T and 3T magnetic resonance imaging were performed  for each screw system. Axial T1- and T2-weighted sequences of representative  thoracic and lumbar regions were assessed for artifacts. The artifacts were  classified as not relevant, considerable, or severe. RESULTS: We evaluated 92  screws and made 178 artifact assessments. The artifacts were clearly visible in  computed tomography scans but did not influence the visualization of intraspinal  structures. Severe magnetic resonance imaging artifacts were found in 28\% (17/60,  mostly in the thoracic spine) of Ti-Ti, 2\% (1/60, all T1 sequences) of C-Ti, and  0\% of C-C, and considerable artifacts were found in 47\% (28/60) of Ti-Ti, 10\%  (6/60, only 1 T2 sequence) of C-Ti, and 0\% of C-C screws (P {$<$} 0.001).  CONCLUSIONS: CFRP pedicle screws reduced the artifact intensity in spinal  structures compared with titanium screws, and may be beneficial for planning  radiotherapy and for follow-up imaging. C-C demonstrated an enhanced effect on  dorsal structures.},

Methods Effect of exercises with a TheraBite to treat trismus was evaluated in 69 head and neck cancer patients of two university medical centers. Mouth opening was measured as interincisal distance in millimeters. Patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics were analyzed for their relationship with change in mouth opening. Variables univariately associated (p\,≤\,0.05) with change in mouth opening were entered in a logistic regression analysis as possible predictors for an increase in mouth opening of the smallest detectable difference of 5~mm or more. Results Mean initial mouth opening was 22.0~mm (SD 6.4); mean increase in mouth opening was 5.4~mm (SD 5.7). “Chemotherapy”, “medical center”, and “time from oncological treatment to start exercises” were significantly associated with an increase in mouth opening. In the logistic regression analysis, “medical center” (β\,=\,1.97) and “time from oncological treatment to start exercises” reduced the odds of reaching an increase in mouth opening of 5~mm or more, β\,=\,−0.11 per month. Conclusions After TheraBite exercises, mouth opening increased averagely with 5.4~mm. The odds of an increase in mouth opening of 5~mm or more reduces if the time from oncological treatment to start exercises lengthens, corrected for the effect of medical center.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: By minimizing imaging artifact and particle scatter, carbon fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketone (CF-PEEK) spinal implants are hypothesized  to enhance radiotherapy (RT) planning/dosing and improve oncological outcomes.  However, robust clinical studies comparing tumor surgery outcomes between CF-PEEK  and traditional metallic implants are lacking. In this paper, the authors  performed a systematic review of the literature with the aim to describe clinical  outcomes in patients with spine tumors who received CF-PEEK implants, focusing on  implant-related complications and oncological outcomes. METHODS: A systematic  review of the literature published between database inception and May 2022 was  performed in accordance with the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic  Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The PubMed database was queried  using the terms "carbon fiber" and "spine" or "spinal." The inclusion criteria  were articles that described patients with CF-PEEK pedicle screw fixation and had  a minimum of 5 patients. Case reports and phantom studies were excluded. RESULTS:  This review included 11 articles with 326 patients (237 with CF-PEEK-based  implants and 89 with titanium-based implants). The mean follow-up period was 13.5  months, and most tumors were metastatic (67.1\%). The rates of implant-related  complications in the CF-PEEK and titanium groups were 7.8\% and 4.7\%,  respectively. The rate of pedicle screw fracture was 1.7\% in the CF-PEEK group  and 2.4\% in the titanium group. The rates of reoperation were 5.7\% (with 60.0\%  because of implant failure or junctional kyphosis) and 4.8\% (all because of  implant failure or junctional kyphosis) in the CF-PEEK and titanium groups,  respectively. When reported, 72.5\% of patients received postoperative RT (41.0\%  stereotactic body RT, 30.8\% fractionated RT, 25.6\% proton, 2.6\% carbon ion). Four  articles suggested that implant artifact was reduced in the CF-PEEK group. Local  recurrence occurred in 14.4\% of CF-PEEK and 10.7\% of titanium-implanted patients.  CONCLUSIONS: While CF-PEEK harbors similar implant failure rates to traditional  metallic implants with reduced imaging artifact, it remains unclear whether  CF-PEEK implants improve oncological outcomes. This study highlights the need for  prospective, direct comparative clinical studies.},

To investigate the activity of Boswellia serrata (BS) in radiotherapy-related edema, we conducted a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, pilot trial. METHODS: Forty-four patients with primary or secondary malignant cerebral tumors were randomly assigned to radiotherapy plus either BS 4200 mg/day or placebo. The volume of cerebral edema in the T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence was analyzed as a primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were toxicity, cognitive function, quality of life, and the need for antiedematous (dexamethasone) medication. Blood samples were taken to analyze the serum concentration of boswellic acids (AKBA and KBA). RESULTS: Compared with baseline and if measured immediately after the end of radiotherapy and BS/placebo treatment, a reduction of cerebral edema of {$>$}75\% was found in 60\% of patients receiving BS and in 26\% of patients receiving placebo (P = .023). These findings may be based on an additional antitumor effect. There were no severe adverse events in either group. In the BS group, 6 patients reported minor gastrointestinal discomfort. BS did not have a significant impact on quality of life or cognitive function. The dexamethasone dose during radiotherapy in both groups was not statistically different. Boswellic acids could be detected in patients' serum. CONCLUSIONS: BS significantly reduced cerebral edema measured by MRI in the study population. BS could potentially be steroid-sparing for patients receiving brain irradiation. Our findings will need to be further validated in larger studies. Cancer 2011. © 2011 American Cancer Society.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metal artifacts due to spinal implants may affect the accuracy of dose calculation for radiotherapy. However, the dosimetric impact of metal  artifact reduction (MAR) for spinal implants in stereotactic body radiotherapy  (SBRT) plans has not been well studied. The objective of this study was to  evaluate the dosimetric impact of MAR in spinal SBRT planning with three  clinically common dose calculation algorithms. METHODS: Gammex phantom and 10  patients' computed tomography (CT) images were studied to investigate the effects  of titanium implants. A commercial orthopedic MAR algorithm was employed to  reduce artifacts. Dose calculations for SBRT were conducted on both  artifact-corrected and uncorrected images using three commercial algorithms  [analytical anisotropic algorithm (AAA), Acuros XB (AXB), and Monte Carlo (MC)].  Dose discrepancies between artifact-corrected and uncorrected cases were  appraised using a dose-volume histogram (DVH) and 3-dimensional (3D) gamma  analysis with different distance to agreement (DTA) and dose difference criteria.  The gamma agreement index (GAI) was denoted as G(∆D, DTA). Statistical analysis  of t-test was utilized to evaluate the dose differences of different algorithms.  RESULTS: The phantom study demonstrated that titanium metal artifacts can be  effectively reduced. The patient cases study showed that dose differences between  the artifact-corrected and uncorrected datasets were small evaluated by gamma  index and DVH. Gamma analysis found that even the strict criterion local G(1,1)  had average values ≥93.9\% for the three algorithms. For all DVH metrics, average  differences did not exceed 0.7\% in planning target volume (PTV) and 2.1\% in  planning risk volume of spinal cord (PRV-SC). Statistical analysis showed that  the observed dose differences of MC method were significantly larger than those  of AAA (P{$<$}0.01 for D98\% of PTV and P{$<$}0.001 for D0.1cc of spinal cord) and AXB  methods (P{$<$}0.001 for D98\% and P{$<$}0.0001 for D0.1cc). CONCLUSIONS: Dosimetric  impact of artifacts caused by titanium implants is not significant in spinal SBRT  planning, which indicates that dose calculation algorithms might not be very  sensitive to CT number variation caused by titanium inserts.},

  abstract = {Background The prevalence of metastatic bone disease in the US population is not well understood. We sought to estimate the current number of US adults with metastatic bone disease using two large administrative data sets. Methods Prevalence was estimated from a commercially insured cohort (ages 18–64 years, MarketScan database) and from a fee-for-service Medicare cohort (ages ≥65 years, Medicare 5\% database) with coverage on December 31, 2008, representing approximately two-thirds of the US population in each age group. We searched for claims-based evidence of metastatic bone disease from January 1, 2004, using a combination of relevant diagnosis and treatment codes. The number of cases in the US adult population was extrapolated from age- and sex-specific prevalence estimated in these cohorts. Results are presented for all cancers combined and separately for primary breast, prostate, and lung cancer. Results In the commercially insured cohort (mean age = 42.3 years [SD = 13.1]), we identified 9505 patients (0.052\%) with metastatic bone disease. Breast cancer was the most common primary tumor type (n = 4041). In the Medicare cohort (mean age = 75.6 years [SD = 7.8]), we identified 6427 (0.495\%) patients with metastatic bone disease. Breast (n = 1798) and prostate (n = 1862) cancers were the most common primary tumor types. We estimate that 279,679 (95\% confidence interval: 274,579–284,780) US adults alive on December 31, 2008, had evidence of metastatic bone disease in the previous 5 years. Breast, prostate, and lung cancers accounted for 68\% of these cases. Conclusion Our findings suggest that approximately 280,000 US adults were living with metastatic bone disease on December 31, 2008. This likely underestimates the true frequency; not all cases of metastatic bone disease are diagnosed, and some diagnosed cases might lack documentation in claims data.},

Results The gold particle fiducials could be easily distinguished from high-density structures, such as the pelvic bone, in diagnostic X-rays but were nearly transparent to a proton beam. The proton dose distribution was distorted {$<$}5\% by the gold particle fiducials with a 4.9\% normalized gold density; this was the case even in the worst configuration (i.e., parallel alignment with a single-direction proton beam). In addition, CT artifacts were dramatically reduced for the gold particle mixture. Conclusion Mixtures of microscopic gold particles and human-compatible polymers have excellent potential as fiducial markers for proton therapy for prostate cancer. These include good radiographic visibility, low distortion of the depth-dose distribution, and few CT artifacts.},

  abstract = {Retinal diseases characterized by pathologic retinal angiogenesis are the leading causes of blindness worldwide. Although therapies directed toward vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) represent a significant step forward in the treatment of proliferative retinopathies, further improvements are needed. In the last few years, an intense research activity has focused around the use of herbal and traditional natural medicines as an alternative for slowing down the progression of proliferative retinopathies. In the present study, we investigated the antiangiogenic effects of acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), one of the active principles derived from the plant Boswellia serrata, used in Ayurvedic systems of medicine. We studied the antiangiogenic properties of AKBA using the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), which mimics the neovascular response seen in human retinopathy of prematurity. We first evaluated the effects of subcutaneously administered AKBA on the expression/activity of proteins which are known to play a role in the OIR model. In the retina, AKBA increased expression and activity of Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase 1 and reduced the phosphorylation of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as well as VEGF expression and VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 phosphorylation. Likely as a result of these effects, AKBA significantly reduced retinal neovascularization in OIR mice without affecting retinal cell survival and retinal function. Using retinal explants cultured in hypoxia and an activator of STAT3 phosphorylation, we showed that the AKBA-induced inhibition of VEGFR-2 phosphorylation is likely to be mediated by a mechanism depending on an SHP-1/STAT3/VEGF axis. In the OIR model, neovascularization results from the activation of retinal endothelial cells, therefore we evaluated whether AKBA affected the angiogenic response of human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs). We observed that AKBA reduced proliferation, migration and tube formation in HRMECs stimulated with exogenous VEGF, while it reduced migration and tube formation in untreated HRMECs. Taken together, our results demonstrate the antiangiogenic effects of AKBA in a model of pathologic neovascularization, providing a rationale for further investigation of AKBA as a promising therapeutic agent to reduce the impact of proliferative retinopathies.},

To explore the factors that may influence Therabite® exercise adherence, how these interrelate and to provide aims for interventions to increase adherence, the authors conducted a multi-centre, formal-evaluative qualitative retrospective study. 21 patients treated for head-neck cancer were interviewed in semi-structured, in-depth interviews. Internal motivation to exercise, the perceived effect, self-discipline and having a clear exercise goal influenced Therabite® exercise adherence positively. Perceiving no effect, limitation in Therabite® opening range and reaching the exercise goal or a plateau in mouth opening were negative influences. Pain, anxiety and the physiotherapist could influence adherence both positively and negatively. Based on the results, a model for Therabite® exercise adherence was proposed. It is important to signal and assess the factors negatively influencing Therabite® adherence, specifically before there is a perceived effect. Research is needed to examine why some patients do not achieve results despite high exercise adherence, to identify effective exercise regimens and to assess proposed interventions aimed to increase Therabite® exercise adherence.},

  abstract = {Background Throughout the last years, carbon‐fibre‐reinforced PEEK (CFP) pedicle screw systems were introduced to replace standard titanium alloy (Ti) implants for spinal instrumentation, promising improved radiotherapy (RT) treatment planning accuracy. We compared the dosimetric impact of both implants for intensity modulated proton (IMPT) and volumetric arc photon therapy (VMAT), with the focus on uncertainties in Hounsfield unit assignment of titanium alloy. Methods Retrospective planning was performed on CT data of five patients with Ti and five with CFP implants. Carbon‐fibre‐reinforced PEEK systems comprised radiolucent pedicle screws with thin titanium‐coated regions and titanium tulips. For each patient, one IMPT and one VMAT plan were generated with a nominal relative stopping power (SP) (IMPT) and electron density (ρ) (VMAT) and recalculated onto the identical CT with increased and decreased SP or ρ by ±6\% for the titanium components. Results Recalculated VMAT dose distributions hardly deviated from the nominal plans for both screw types. IMPT plans resulted in more heterogeneous target coverage, measured by the standard deviation σ inside the target, which increased on average by 7.6~±~2.3\% (Ti) vs 3.4~±~1.2\% (CFP). Larger SPs lead to lower target minimum doses, lower SPs to higher dose maxima, with a more pronounced effect for Ti screws. Conclusions While VMAT plans showed no relevant difference in dosimetric quality between both screw types, IMPT plans demonstrated the benefit of CFP screws through a smaller dosimetric impact of CT‐value uncertainties compared to Ti. Reducing metal components in implants will therefore improve dose calculation accuracy and lower the risk for tumor underdosage.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE The aim of this paper was to evaluate the prognostic factors in surgical and adjuvant care for spinal chordomas and chondrosarcomas after surgery followed by high-dose pencil-beam scanning proton therapy (PBS-PT). METHODS From 1997 to 2016, 155 patients (61 female patients; median age 55 years) with spinal (cervical, n = 61; thoracic, n = 29; lumbar, n = 13; sacral, n = 46; pelvic, n = 6) classic chordomas (n = 116) and chondrosarcomas (n = 39; most were low grade) were treated with maximal safe resection followed by PBS-PT (median dose prescribed: 74 Gy [relative biological effectiveness], range 48.6–77 Gy). The majority of patients (n = 153, 98.7\%) had undergone at least 1 resection prior to PBS-PT (median 1, range 0–5; biopsy only, n = 2). Fewer than half (45.1\%) of the surgeries were rated as gross-total resections (GTRs) prior to PBS-PT. Surgical stabilization (SS) was present in 39\% of all patients (n = 60). Ninety-one patients (59\%) presented with macroscopic tumor at the start of PBS-PT. The median follow-up duration was 64.7 months (range 12.2–204.8 months). RESULTS The 5-year local tumor control, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival were 64.9\% (95\% CI 56.3\%–73.5\%), 59.4\% (95\% CI 50.6\%–68.2\%), and 77.9\% (95\% CI 70.6\%–85.2\%), respectively. In total, 63 patients (40.6\%) experienced failure during the follow-up period: local only in 32 (20.6\%), distal only in 7 (4.5\%), local + distal in 19 (12.3\%), surgical pathway failure (SPF) only in 2 (1.3\%), local + SPF in 2 (1.3\%), and distal + SPF in 1 ({$<$} 1\%). Univariate analysis identified gross residual disease, the presence of SS, and treatment era prior to 2008 as highly significant for worse outcome, with all 3 remaining significant on multivariate analysis. The type of surgery (GTR or subtotal resection/biopsy) and whether GTR was achieved by en bloc or curettage did not show a significant prognostic effect. Surgical complications prior to PBS-PT were present in 42.5\% of all surgically treated patients and were seen more commonly in patients with multiple surgical interventions (p = 0.005) and those operated on with the intent of en bloc resection (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS The extent of resection and metallic stabilization substantially influenced clinical outcomes for patients with spinal chordoma or chondrosarcoma despite high-dose adjuvant PBS-PT. Optimal upfront surgical management of these tumors continues to include GTR, as possible, with prompt adjuvant proton therapy.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Axillary soft tissue (AXT) involvement with tumor cells extending beyond the positive lymph node (LN+) and extracapsular extension (ECE) has been overlooked in breast pathology specimen analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 2,162 LN+ patients, dividing them into four groups on the basis of axillary pathology: (1) LN+ only, (2) LN+ and ECE only, (3) LN+ and AXT without ECE, and (4) LN+ with both AXT and ECE. The primary end points were 10-year locoregional failure (LRF), the 10-year axillary failure, and 10-year distant metastasis rates. Multivariable Cox models, accounting for clinical factors, were fitted using the entire cohort, and subgroups analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 9.4 years. The 10-year distant metastasis incidence was 42\% for LN + AXT + ECE, 23\% for both LN + AXT and LN + ECE only, and 13\% for LN+ only. The 10-year axillary failure rates were 4.5\% for LN + AXT + ECE, 4.6\% for LN + AXT, 0.8\% for LN + ECE only, and 1.6\% for LN+ only. The 10-year LRF rates were 14\% for LN + AXT + ECE, 10\% for LN + AXT, 5.7\% for LN + ECE only, and 6.2\% for LN+ only. Multivariable analysis revealed that AXT was significantly associated with distant metastasis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.6; P {$<$} .001), locoregional failure (HR, 2.3; P {$<$} .001), and axillary failure (HR, 3.3; P = .003). Subgroup analyses showed that regional LN radiation (RLNR) improved locoregional tumor outcomes with AXT, ECE, or both (HR, 0.5; P = .03). Delivering ≤50 Gy to the axilla in the presence of AXT/ECE increased axillary failure (HR, 3.0; P = .04). Moreover, when delivering RLNR, axillary LN dissection could be de-escalated to sentinel node biopsy even in the presence of features such as AXT or ECE without significantly increasing any failure outcome: (HR, 1.0; P = .92) for LRF, (HR, 1.1; P = .94) axillary failure, and (HR, 0.4; P = .01) distant metastasis. CONCLUSION: Routine reporting of axillary tissue involvement, beyond LNs and ECE, is crucial in predicting breast cancer outcomes. Ruling out the presence of AXT is imperative before any form of axillary de-escalation, especially RLNR omission.},

In most cases, the range may be calculated with sufficient accuracy using  kilovoltage (kV) computed tomography (CT) images. However, metal implants such as  hip prostheses can cause severe streak artifacts that lead to large uncertainties  in proton range. The purposes of this study were to quantify streak-related range  errors and to determine if they could be avoided by using artifact-free  megavoltage (MV) CT images in treatment planning. Proton treatment plans were  prepared for a rigid, heterogeneous phantom and for a prostate cancer patient  with a metal hip prosthesis using corrected and uncorrected kVCT images alone,  uncorrected MVCT images and a combination of registered MVCT and kVCT images (the  hybrid approach). Streak-induced range errors of 5-12 mm were present in the  uncorrected kVCT-based patient plan. Correcting the streaks by manually assigning  estimated true Hounsfield units improved the range accuracy. In a rigid  heterogeneous phantom, the implant-related range uncertainty was estimated at {$<$}3  mm for both the corrected kVCT-based plan and the uncorrected MVCT-based plan.  The hybrid planning approach yielded the best overall result. In this approach,  the kVCT images provided good delineation of soft tissues due to high-contrast  resolution, and the streak-free MVCT images provided smaller range uncertainties  because they did not require artifact correction.},

The objective of this study was to determine what types of implantable markers are visible in setup radiographs and, at the same time, perturb the therapeutic proton dose to the prostate by less than 10\%. The radiographic visibility of the markers was assessed by visual inspection of lateral setup radiographs of a pelvic phantom using a kilovoltage x-ray imaging system. The fiducial-induced perturbations in the proton dose were estimated with Monte Carlo simulations. The influence of marker material, size, placement depth and orientation within the pelvis was examined. The radiographic tests confirmed that gold and stainless steel markers were clearly visible and that titanium markers were not. The Monte Carlo simulations revealed that titanium and stainless steel markers minimally perturbed the proton beam, but gold markers cast unacceptably large dose shadows. A 0.9 mm diameter, 3.1 mm long cylindrical stainless steel marker provides good radiographic visibility yet perturbs the proton dose distribution in the prostate by less than 8\% when using a parallel opposed lateral beam arrangement.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of structured exercise with jaw mobilizing devices on trismus and its effect on trismus symptomatology and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in head and neck (H\&N) cancer patients. Material and methods. Fifty patients with H\&N cancer and trismus, i.e. maximum interincisal opening (MIO) ≤ 35 mm participated in a structured intervention program with jaw exercise. The patients in the intervention group underwent a 10-week exercise program with regular follow-up. A control group comprising of 50 patients with trismus and H\&N cancer were matched to the intervention group according to gender, tumor location, tumor stage, comorbidity and age. HRQL and trismus-related symptoms were assessed. Results. The mean MIO improvement was 6.4 mm (4.8–8.0) and 0.7 (−0.3–1.7) mm in the intervention group and control group respectively, three months post-intervention commencement (p {$<$} 0.001). The intervention group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in Role functioning, Social functioning and Global quality of life (EORTC QLQ C30) and in all Gothenburg Trismus Questionnaire (GTQ) domains, i.e. jaw-related problems (p {$<$} 0.001), eating limitation (p {$<$} 0.05) and muscular tension (p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusion. We found that a structured jaw exercise program was effective and improved the mouth opening capacity significantly.

  abstract = {Gum resin extracts of Boswellia species have been traditionally applied in folk medicine for centuries to treat various chronic inflammatory diseases, and experimental data from animal models and studies with human subjects confirmed the potential of B. spec extracts for the treatment of not only inflammation but also of cancer. Analysis of the ingredients of these extracts revealed that the pentacyclic triterpenes boswellic acids (BAs) possess biological activities and appear to be responsible for the respective pharmacological actions. Approaches in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological effects of BAs identified 5-lipoxygenase, human leukocyte elastase, toposiomerase I and II, as well as IkappaB kinases as molecular targets of BAs. Moreover, it was shown that depending on the cell type and the structure of the BAs, the compounds differentially interfere with signal transduction pathways including Ca(2+/-) and MAPK signaling in various blood cells, related to functional cellular processes important for inflammatory reactions and tumor growth. This review summarizes the biological actions of BAs on the cellular and molecular level and attempts to put the data into perspective of the beneficial effects manifested in animal studies and trials with human subjects related to inflammation and cancer.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Surgical treatment of spinal tumors regularly includes spinal instrumentation with pedicle screws. Most modern pedicle screws are made of titanium alloy, which is associated with artifacts on postoperative imaging such as computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging. These artifacts hamper radiation treatment planning and execution and follow-up imaging. Recently, carbon fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketone (CFRP) implants became available for posterior instrumentation with the aim to reduce imaging artifacts by implants. METHODS: Patients harboring spinal tumors underwent posterior stabilization using CFRP pedicle screws. Postoperative imaging was evaluated for implant artifacts. Radiation planning was assessed. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients with spinal tumors were assessed (metastases n~= 30; lymphoma n~= 2, myeloma n~= 1, chordoma n~= 1, fibrous dysplasia n~= 1). Implantation of CFRP implants was feasible in all but 1 case. Postoperative images show reduced artifacts in comparison with standard titanium alloy implants. Implant position and integrity is sufficiently assessable despite reduced image contrast. Radiation planning is improved. CONCLUSIONS: Carbon fiber-reinforced PEEK pedicle screws reduce image artifacts on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Thereby, they are a valuable and feasible option for spinal instrumentations in patients harboring spinal tumors where postoperative imaging and radiation therapy planning are necessary and might be crucial for long-term outcome and overall survival.},

METHODS: A Cox regression model was used to estimate the effect of fractures (time-dependent variable) on survival in patients with stage III multiple myeloma or bone metastases from solid tumors enrolled in 3 large trials. Patients were randomized to receive zoledronic acid, pamidronate, or placebo every 3-4 weeks for up to 24 months (prostate cancer, breast cancer, and multiple myeloma) or up to 21 months (lung and other solid tumors). RESULTS: A total of 3049 patients with multiple myeloma (n = 513), breast (n = 1130), prostate (n = 640), or lung cancer or other solid tumors (n = 766) were included in this analysis. Patients with multiple myeloma had the highest fracture incidence (43\%), followed by breast (35\%), prostate (19\%), and lung cancer (17\%). In all tumor types except lung, pathologic fracture was associated with a significant increase in risk of death, and breast cancer patients had the greatest increased risk. After adjustment for baseline characteristics, including performance status and prior skeletal complications, breast cancer patients who developed a pathologic fracture on study had a significant 32\% increased risk of death relative to patients without a fracture (hazard ratio = 1.32; P {$<$} .01); patients with multiple myeloma or prostate cancer had a {$>$}20\% increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that fractures are associated with increased risk of death in patients with malignant bone disease. Therefore, preventing fractures is an important goal of therapy.},

Screening for additional effects of boswellic acids on further proinflammatory pathways, we observed that acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid, an established direct, nonredox and noncompetitive 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, decreased the activity of human leukocyte elastase (HLE) in vitro with an IC50 value of about 15 μM. Among the pentacyclic triterpenes tested in concentrations up to 20 μM, we also observed substantial inhibition by β-boswellic acid, amyrin and ursolic acid, but not by 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid. The data show that the dual inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase and HLE is unique to boswellic acids: other pentacyclic triterpenes with HLE inhibitory activities (e.g., ursolic acid and amyrin) do not inhibit 5-lipoxygenase, and leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors from different chemical classes (e.g., NDGA, MK-886 and ZM-230,487) do not impair HLE activity. Because leukotriene formation and HLE release are increased simultaneously by neutrophil stimulation in a variety of inflammation- and hypersensitivity-based human diseases, the reported blockade of two proinflammatory enzymes by boswellic acids might be the rationale for the putative antiphlogistic activity of acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid and derivatives.},

While prostaglandine synthesis can be influenced by NSAIDs therapeutical approaches to the 5-lipoxygenase pathway are rare. Resinous extracts of Boswellia serrata (H15, indish incense), known from traditional ayurvedic medicine, decrease leukotriene synthesis in vitro. Case reports suggest a clinical role for that drug. METHODS: Outpatients with active RA have been enrolled into a multicenter controlled trial. Patients received 9 tablets of active drug (3600 mg) or placebo daily in addition to their previous therapy. Doses of NSAIDs could be adjusted on demand. Efficacy parameters, Ritchies Index for swelling and pain, ESR, CRP, pain on VAS and NSAID dose were documented at baseline and 6 and 12 weeks after initiation. Mean values and medians were calculated to compare the groups for significant or clinically relevant change from baseline or difference between both groups at any time point of observation. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients were recruited in 4 centers, the data have been published in abstract form. Only 37 patients (verum 18, placebo 19), enrolled in Ratingen were available for detailed efficacy and safety analysis. All evaluations in these patients were performed by one investigator (G.H.). There was no subjective, clinical or laboratory parameter showing a significant or clinically relevant change from baseline or difference between both groups at any time point of observation. The mean NSAID dose reduction reached levels of 5.8\% (H15) and 3.1\% (placebo). One patient in each group showed a good response in all parameters but 4 patients in each group worsened. The others showed no alteration of their disease. CONCLUSION: Treatment with H15 showed no measurable efficacy. Controlled studies including a greater patient population are necessary to confirm or reject our results.},

  abstract = {Trismus is characterized by a reduced ability to open the mouth, directly affecting many aspects of daily life, such as chewing, swallowing, speaking and maintaining oral hygiene. Several studies have shown that trismus affects health related quality of life. Radiotherapy in the head and neck area is identified as one of the most frequent causes of trismus in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. Currently, there is no standard treatment for trismus. Several stretching techniques and jaw mobilizing devices are available, but their effect in radiotherapy-induced trismus is still largely unknown. With this review we give an overview of the present relevant literature and compare the effect of exercise therapy versus no exercise therapy on jaw mobility, expressed in millimeters mouth opening, in HNC patients with radiotherapy-induced trismus. A systematic literature search in four electronic bibliographic databases was conducted in July 2014. Selected articles were critically appraised on relevance and validity. Best available evidence was analyzed and compared. Three of the four selected articles show a significant increase (p-value{$<$}0.05) in maximal interincisal opening (MIO) after exercise therapy using a jaw-mobilizing device. One article reports a significant decrease in MIO. However, this decrease is less in the intervention group, which implies a positive effect of exercise therapy. Based on this current best clinical evidence, it can be assumed that exercise therapy with a jaw-mobilizing device yields better results than no exercise, with regards to opening of the mouth in HNC patients with radiotherapy-induced trismus.},

  abstract = {Trismus can be a problematic consequence of treatment for oral and oropharyngeal cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between trismus, subjective function and health-related quality of life, in order to postulate a clinically relevant cut-off that might be useful as an indicator of patients who might benefit from intervention. One hundred consecutive patients attending the Maxillofacial Oncology clinic at the University Hospital Aintree were assessed during a period of four months. Mouth opening was recorded in millimetres. Subjective outcomes were evaluated using UW-QOL questionnaire for chewing, saliva, mood, anxiety and overall quality of life. The median age of patients was 63 (IQR 56–69) years. The median time since treatment was 16 (IQR 6–34) months. The median mouth opening (32mm; range 6–53, IQR 24–40) was associated strongly with clinical T stage (Tis/T1–2 35mm, T3–4 24mm), radiotherapy (no 38mm, yes 27mm) and type of primary surgery (primary closure 38mm, soft-tissue flaps 30mm, composite flaps 24mm). The amount of mouth opening and of the single question (about how much less mouth opening since treatment) was significantly associated with patients perception of chewing deficit, less than full diet and less than good overall quality of life. This study supports a 35mm cut-off for trismus. There is merit including the two elements together (opening in mm and the single item question on mouth opening since treatment) as outcome parameters},

  abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate a novel spine implant, carbon-fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketone (CFR-PEEK), for proton and photon treatment planning.  Materials and Methods: We compared target coverage and sparing of organs-at-risk  (OARs) for a spinal phantom with 4 different spine configurations: (a) normal (no  implant); (b) Titanium; (c) CFR-PEEK; and (d) hybrid (CFR-PEEK with Titanium  tulip head). The spinal phantom was imaged via computed tomography (CT) scan, and  the iterative Metal Artifact Reduction (iMAR) CT set was used for planning. A  representative spinal chordoma target and associated OARs were contoured. The  prescription dose was 50 Gy to the initial target volume, followed by a 24 Gy  boost, for which multi-field optimization (MFO) proton plans were developed with  a 3\hspace{0.25em}mm setup and 3.5\% range uncertainties. For photon planning, volumetric  modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans were developed for the initial and boost  plans. OAR dose constraints were set according to our institutional guidelines.  Results: For the 4 spine configurations, the proton plans achieved similar  nominal target coverage and OARs sparing. While evaluating coverage and OAR dose  under uncertainty scenario analysis for initial clinical target volume (CTV) 50  Gy 95\% and 90\% coverage, higher means and the narrower band of doses variations  were achieved for the normal and CFR-PEEK plans. Similarly, uncertainty analysis  of spinal cord D(max) showed tighter distribution for normal and CFR-PEEK plans.  Overall plan quality showed no significant difference for photon planning when  compared to normal spine versus other inserts. However, for proton planning,  there is a larger difference for the normal spine insert scenario versus the  Titanium insert scenario. For each insert scenario comparison between photon and  proton plans, there was a larger difference for OARs: heart and spinal cord.  Conclusion: The CFR-PEEK implant has similar clinical properties to a normal  spine for proton planning, allowing us to pass protons through the material and  achieve superior target coverage and OAR sparing under nominal and uncertainty  conditions.},

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to characterize local control (LC), overall survival (OS), pain response rates, and toxicity following SBRT. METHODS: Primary outcomes were 1-year LC, incidences of acute and late Grade 3-5 toxicities, and overall pain response rate at 3 months. The secondary outcome was 1-year OS. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was employed for assessment of study bias, with a median score of 5⋆ for included studies (range: 4-8). Weighted random effects meta-analyses were conducted to estimate effect sizes. RESULTS: We identified 528 patients with 597 non-spinal bone lesions across 9 studies, 1 prospective and 8 retrospective observational, treated with SBRT. The estimated 1-year LC rate was 94.6\% (95\% CI: 87.0-99.0\%). The estimated 3-month combined partial and complete pain response rate following SBRT was 87.7\% (95\% CI: 55.1-100.0\%). The estimated combined acute and late Grade 3-5 toxicity rate was 0.5\% (95\% CI: 0-5.0\%) with an estimated pathologic fracture rate of 3.1\% (95\% CI: 0.2-9.1\%). The estimated 1-year OS rate was 71.0\% (95\% CI: 51.7-87.0\%). CONCLUSIONS: SBRT resulted in excellent LC and palliation of symptoms with minimal related toxicity. Prospective investigations are warranted to further characterizes long-term outcomes with SBRT for patients with non-spinal bone metastases.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Since most radiation treatment plans are based on computed tomography (CT) images, which makes it difficult to define the targeted tumor volume located  near a metal implant, this study aims to evaluate and compare three treatment  plans in order to optimally reduce geometrical uncertainty in external radiation  treatment of localized prostate cancer. METHODS: Experimental subjects were three  prostate patients with bilateral hip prosthesis who had undergone radical  radiotherapy. The treatment plans were five-field three-dimensional conformal  radiation therapy (3D-CRT), fixed 5-field intensity-modulated radiation therapy  (IMRT) using similar gantry angles, and single-arc volumetric modulated arc  therapy (VMAT). The monitor units (MUs), dose volume histograms (DVHs), the dose  indices of planning target volume (PTV), clinical target volume (CTV) and rectum  were compared among the three techniques. The geometrical uncertainties were  evaluated by shifting the iso-center (2- 10{$\mkern1mu$}mm in the anterior, posterior, left,  right, superior, and inferior directions). The CTV and rectum dose indexes with  and without the iso-center shifts were compared in each plan. RESULTS: The  Conformity Index of PTV were 1.35 in 3D-CRT, 1.12 in IMRT, and 1.04 in VMAT,  respectively. The rectum doses in 3D-CRT are also higher than those in IMRT and  VMAT. The iso-center shift little affected the CTV dose when smaller than the  margin size. The rectum dose increased especially after a posterior shift.  Additionally, this dose increase was larger in the VMAT plan than in the 3D- CRT  plan. However, the VMAT achieved a superior rectum DVH to that of 3D- CRT, and  this effect clearly exceeded the rectum-dose increase elicited by the iso-center  shift. CONCLUSION: For radiotherapy treatment of localized prostate cancer in  patients with hip prosthesis, the dose distribution was better in the VMAT and  Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR)-CT image methods than the conventional methods.  Because the anatomical structure of the male pelvic region is relatively constant  among individuals, we consider that VMAT is a valid treatment plan despite  analyzing just three cases.},

Objective To examine the effectiveness of a dynamic jaw opening device as part of a multimodal treatment strategy for trismus in patients with head and neck cancer. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Tertiary care cancer center. Participants Patients with head and neck cancer and trismus (N=20). Intervention All patients underwent assessment by a board-certified physiatrist and were referred to physical therapy for delivery of the DTS and instructed to progress use of the DTS to 30 minutes 3 times a day. Additional modalities for the treatment of trismus including pain medications and botulinum toxin injections were prescribed as clinically indicated. Main Outcome Measures Change in maximal interincisal distance (MID) as documented in the medical record. Results The use of the DTS as part of multimodal therapy including physical therapy, pain medications, and botulinum toxin injections as deemed clinically appropriate resulted in an overall improvement of the MID from 16.5mm to 23.5mm (P{$<$}.001). Patients who could comply with the treatment recommendations for DTS treatment did better than those who could not, with an improvement of the MID from 16mm to 27mm (P{$<$}.001) versus 17mm to 22mm (P=.88). Conclusions The DTS is a safe and effective component of a multimodal strategy for improving trismus associated with head and neck cancer and its treatment. Further investigation is needed to determine the relative efficacy of the treatment modalities available for trismus including physical therapy and other jaw stretching devices.},

The radiolucency of CFR-polyether ether ketone implants has the  potential to benefit patients with spine tumor. Clinical studies have shown no  increase in complications with implementation of CFR-polyether ether ketone  implants, and these devices seem to have sufficient stiffness and pullout  strength. However, further trials are necessary to determine if there is a  clinically significant impact on local tumor control.},

Materials and Methods: In a randomized, prospective, open-label, comparative study the efficacy, safety and tolerability of BSE was compared with valdecoxib in 66 patients of OA of knee for six months. The patients were assessed by WOMAC scale at baseline and thereafter at monthly interval till 1 month after drug discontinuation. Antero-posterior radiographs of affected knee joint were taken at baseline and after 6 months.  Results: In BSE group the pain, stiffness, difficulty in performing daily activities showed statistically significant improvement with two months of therapy which even lasted till one month after stopping the intervention. In valdecoxib group the statistically significant improvement in all parameters was reported after one month of therapy but the effect persisted only as long as drug therapy continued. Three patients from BSE group and two from valdecoxib group complained of acidity. One patient from BSE group complained of diarrhea and abdominal cramps.  Conclusion:  BSE showed a slower onset of action but the effect persisted even after stopping therapy while the action of valdecoxib became evident faster but waned rapidly after stopping the treatment.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate dosimetric errors in proton therapy treatment planning due to titanium implants, and to determine how these affect postoperative  passively scattered proton therapy for chordoma patients with orthopedic  hardware. METHODS: The presence of titanium hardware near the tumor may affect  the dosimetric accuracy of proton therapy. Artifacts in the computed tomography  (CT) scan can cause errors in the proton stopping powers used for dose  calculation, which are derived from CT numbers. Also, clinical dose calculation  algorithms may not accurately simulate proton beam transport through the  implants, which have very different properties as compared to human tissue. The  authors first evaluated the impact of these two main issues. Dose errors  introduced by metal artifacts were studied using phantoms with and without  titanium inserts, and patient scans on which a metal artifact reduction method  was applied. Pencil-beam dose calculations were compared to models of nuclear  interactions in titanium and Monte Carlo simulations. Then, to assess the overall  impact on treatment plans for chordoma, the authors compared the original  clinical treatment plans to recalculated dose distributions employing both metal  artifact reduction and Monte Carlo methods. RESULTS: Dose recalculations of  clinical proton fields showed that metal artifacts cause range errors up to 6 mm  distal to regions affected by CT artifacts. Monte Carlo simulations revealed dose  differences {$>$}10\% in the high-dose area, and range differences up to 10 mm. Since  these errors are mostly local in nature, the large number of fields limits the  impact on target coverage in the chordoma treatment plans to a small decrease of  dose homogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: In the presence of titanium implants, CT metal  artifacts and the approximations of pencil-beam dose calculations cause  considerable errors in proton dose calculation. The spatial distribution of the  errors however limits the overall impact on passively scattered proton therapy  for chordoma.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Adverse radiation effects (AREs) can occur after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and symptomatic cases are often treated with corticosteroids, pentoxifylline, and vitamin E. The supplement 5-Loxin (Boswellia serrata) is an extract of Indian frankincense that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor expression and has been shown to reduce perilesional edema in brain tumor patients undergoing fractionated radiation. OBSERVATIONS Three patients underwent SRS for meningioma or metastasis and developed symptomatic AREs at 4 to 8 months. They were initially treated with corticosteroids, pentoxifylline, and vitamin E with transient improvement followed by recurrent neurological symptoms and imaging findings as steroids were tapered off. All patients were rescued by the administration of 5-Loxin with resolution of neurological symptoms and imaging changes, discontinuation of steroids, and no medication side effects. LESSONS The author’s early experience with 5-Loxin has been encouraging, and this supplement has become the author’s first-line treatment for acute radiation effects after SRS. The author reserves bevacizumab for significant mass effect or failure of oral therapy. 5-Loxin has many advantages including low cost, ease of use, and patient tolerability. More experience is needed to confirm the role of 5-Loxin in the upfront treatment of AREs.},

  abstract = {Accurate dose calculation is essential to precision radiation treatment planning and this accuracy depends upon anatomic and tissue electron density information. Modern treatment planning inhomogeneity corrections use x-ray CT images and calibrated scales of tissue CT number to electron density to provide this information. The presence of metal in the volume scanned by an x-ray CT scanner causes metal induced image artefacts that influence CT numbers and thereby introduce errors in the radiation dose distribution calculated. This paper investigates the dosimetric improvement achieved by a previously proposed x-ray CT metal artefact suppression technique when the suppressed images of a patient with bilateral hip prostheses are used in commercial treatment planning systems for proton, electron or photon therapies. For all these beam types, this clinical image and treatment planning study reveals that the target may be severely underdosed if a metal artefact-contaminated image is used for dose calculations instead of the artefact suppressed one. Of the three beam types studied, the metal artefact suppression is most important for proton therapy dose calculations, intermediate for electron therapy and least important for x-ray therapy but still significant. The study of a water phantom having a metal rod simulating a hip prosthesis indicates that CT numbers generated after image processing for metal artefact suppression are accurate and thus dose calculations based on the metal artefact suppressed images will be of high fidelity.},

Median follow-up time was 9 months., Results: Median overall survival time was 14 months (95\% CI: 12-17). Secondary surgical intervention at the same location was necessary in 1 patient of group 1 (2\%), 2 patients of group 2(5\%) and 2 patients of group 3 (15\%), respectively (p=0.097).

  abstract = {Purpose This report describes the dosimetric analyses of a Phase I/II protocol, designed to examine the capabilities of an institutionally developed intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) system with respect to dose escalation. The protocol employed stringent dosimetric guidelines in the treatment of locally advanced head-and-neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) with radiotherapy alone using IMRT and the simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique. Methods and materials The first 14 patients enrolled on the protocol were included in this analysis. Escalating doses of 68.1 Gy (6 patients), 70.8 Gy (6 patients), and 73.8 Gy (2 patients) were delivered to the gross tumor volume (GTV) in 30 fractions. Simultaneously, constant dose coverage was given to the subclinical disease and the electively treated nodal regions, which received 60 Gy and 54 Gy, respectively, in all three cohorts. Parotid glands were spared to the degree possible without compromising target coverage. The following indices are reported for the GTV: (1) dose to specified percent volumes (e.g., D98 and D2); (2) homogeneity index defined as the ratio (D2 - D98)/Dprescription; (3) biologically equivalent uniform dose (EUD); and (4) an index of conformality, PITV, defined as the ratio of volume enclosed within the prescribed isodose surface to the target volume. Treatments were planned and delivered with nine 6-MV photon beams using the multileaf collimator (MLC) “sliding window” technique. Results Mean doses to 98\% of GTV were 68.4 Gy, 70.5 Gy, and 70.8 Gy, and average GTV dose homogeneity was 6.7\%, 7.6\%, and 8.8\% for the three cohorts. The average doses to the parotid gland proximal to and distant from GTV were 41.3 Gy and 25.7 Gy, respectively. Dose distributions measured in phantom showed good agreement with calculations. Conclusions Treatment of locally advanced HNSCC using SIB-IMRT as described is feasible. Treatment planning and delivery are safer and more efficient than with conventional three-dimensional processes. Predicted dose distributions can be accurately delivered with excellent conformality using dynamic MLC. At least one of the parotid glands can be adequately spared. Patient follow-up continues and will allow eventual quantitative correlation of delivered dose distributions with clinical outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In spinal oncology, titanium implants pose several challenges including artifact on advanced imaging and therapeutic radiation perturbation. To  mitigate these effects, there has been increased interest in radiolucent carbon  fiber (CF) and CF-reinforced polyetheretherketone (CFR-PEEK) implants as an  alternative for spinal reconstruction. This study surveyed the members of the  North American Spine Society (NASS) section of Spinal Oncology to query their  perspectives regarding the clinical utility, current practice patterns, and  recommended future directions of radiolucent spinal implants. METHODS: In  February 2021, an anonymous survey was administered to the physicians of the NASS  section of Spinal Oncology. Participation in the survey was optional. The survey  contained 38 items including demographic questions as well as multiple-choice,  yes/no questions, Likert rating scales, and short free-text responses pertaining  to the "clinical concept", "efficacy", "problems/complications", "practice  pattern", and "future directions" of radiolucent spinal implants. RESULTS:  Fifteen responses were received (71.4\% response rate). Six of the participants  (40\%) were neurosurgeons, eight (53.3\%) were orthopedic surgeons, and one was a  spinal radiation oncologist. Overall, there were mixed opinions among the  specialists. While several believed that radiolucent spinal implants provide  substantial benefits for the detection of disease recurrence and radiation  therapy options, others remained less convinced. Ongoing concerns included high  costs, low availability, limited cervical and percutaneous options, and  suboptimal screw and rod designs. As such, participants estimated that they  currently utilize these implants for 27.3\% of anterior and 14.7\% of all posterior  reconstructions after tumor resection. CONCLUSION: A survey of the NASS section  of Spinal Oncology found a lack of consensus with regards to the imaging and  radiation benefits, and several ongoing concerns about currently available  options. Therefore, routine utilization of these implants for anterior and  posterior spinal reconstructions remains low. Future investigations are warranted  to practically validate these devices' theoretical risks and benefits.},

  abstract = {Proton beam treatment is being looked favourably now in breast treatment. Tissue expanders are often placed after mastectomy that contains metallic port for  saline injection which produces dose perturbations in proton beam therapy with  uncertain dosimetry. Dose perturbation for a stainless-steel injection port from  a breast implant is investigated in this study. Measurements, Monte-Carlo  simulation, and calculated dose distribution of plans based on kVCT and MVCT  images are compared. Treatment plans are performed on kVCT and MVCT images to  observe the effect of metal artifact from the breast implant. The kVCT based plan  underestimates the beam range due to the overestimated water equivalent thickness  of the metal ports as a result of image degradation. Compared to the measurement  with metal port in the proton beam, the MVCT-based treatment planning provides  more accurate dose calculation than the kVCT-based results. The dose perturbation  factor calculated from MVCT planning is within 10\% of the measurement results  while HU corrected kVCT plan still shows dose difference as large as 100\% due to  the incorrect range pull back calculation caused by the misrepresentation of the  volume between the plastic cap and the stainless-steel base. The dose enhancement  observed at the metal and solid water interface is as large as 15\%, which needs  to be accounted for in the planning process if there is a clinical concern. Dose  reduction as large as 16\% is observed with depth from 1 cm to 4 cm underneath the  thickest part of the metallic port whereas lateral dose perturbation is also seen  up to 7 mm. The measurement data are supported by the Monte-Carlo simulated  results with a maximum dose difference of 6\%. It is concluded that if proton beam  is used with metallic port, MVCT imaging data is recommended. In lieu of MVCT,  DECT, CT scanner with metal artifact reduction software or in the very least,  extended HU range should be used to reduce the streaking artifact as well as to  produce a more accurate image of the metallic port.},
