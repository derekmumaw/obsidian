# Abstract
Fibroblasts are the main cells of connective tissue and have pivotal roles in the proliferative and maturation phases of wound healing. These cells can secrete various cytokines, growth factors, and collagen. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a unique factor in the migration process of fibroblast cells through induces wound healing cascade components such as angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and epithelialization. This study aimed to create VEGF165 overexpressing fibroblast cells to evaluate angiogenesis function in wound healing. In vitro, a novel recombinant expression vector, pcDNA3.1(-)-VEGF, was produced and transfected into the fibroblast cells. Following selecting fibroblast cells with hygromycin, recombinant cells were investigated in terms of VEGF expression by quantifying and qualifying methods. Mechanical, physical, and survival properties of polyurethane-cellulose acetate (PU-CA) scaffold were investigated. Finally, in vivo, the angiogenic potential was evaluated in four groups containing control, PU-CA, PU-CA with fibroblast cells, and VEGF-expressing cells on days 0, 2, 5, 12 and 15. Wound biopsies were harvested and the healing process was histopathologically evaluated on different days. qRT-PCR showed VEGF overexpression (sevenfold) in genetically-manipulated cells compared to fibroblast cells. Recombinant VEGF expression was also confirmed by western blotting. Manipulated fibroblast cells represented more angiogenesis than other groups on the second day after surgery, which was also confirmed by the antiCD31 antibody. The percentage of wound closure area on day 5 in genetically-manipulated Hu02 and Hu02 groups showed a significant reduction of wound area compared to other groups. These findings indicate that overexpression of VEGF165 in fibroblast cells results in enhanced angiogenesis and formation of granulated tissue in the early stage of the healing process, which can show its therapeutic potential in patients with impaired wound healing and also provide functional support for gene therapy.
