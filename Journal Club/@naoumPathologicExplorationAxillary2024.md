>[!Abstract]
>## PURPOSE: 
>Axillary soft tissue (AXT) involvement with tumor cells extending beyond the positive lymph node (LN+) and extracapsular extension (ECE) has been overlooked in breast pathology specimen analysis. 
>
>## MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
>We analyzed 2,162 LN+ patients, dividing them into four groups on the basis of axillary pathology: (1) LN+ only, (2) LN+ and ECE only, (3) LN+ and AXT without ECE, and (4) LN+ with both AXT and ECE. The primary end points were 10-year locoregional failure (LRF), the 10-year axillary failure, and 10-year distant metastasis rates. Multivariable Cox models, accounting for clinical factors, were fitted using the entire cohort, and subgroups analyses were conducted. 
>
>## RESULTS: 
>- The median follow-up was 9.4 years. 
>- The 10-year distant metastasis incidence was 42% for LN + AXT + ECE, 23% for both LN + AXT and LN + ECE only, and 13% for LN+ only. 
>- The 10-year axillary failure rates were 4.5% for LN + AXT + ECE, 4.6% for LN + AXT, 0.8% for LN + ECE only, and 1.6% for LN+ only. 
>- The 10-year LRF rates were 14% for LN + AXT + ECE, 10% for LN + AXT, 5.7% for LN + ECE only, and 6.2% for LN+ only.
>- Multivariable analysis revealed that AXT was significantly associated with distant metastasis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.6; P < .001), locoregional failure (HR, 2.3; P < .001), and axillary failure (HR, 3.3; P = .003). 
>- Subgroup analyses showed that regional LN radiation (RLNR) improved locoregional tumor outcomes with AXT, ECE, or both (HR, 0.5; P = .03). 
>- Delivering â‰¤50 Gy to the axilla in the presence of AXT/ECE increased axillary failure (HR, 3.0; P = .04). 
>- Moreover, when delivering RLNR, axillary LN dissection could be de-escalated to sentinel node biopsy even in the presence of features such as AXT or ECE without significantly increasing any failure outcome: (HR, 1.0; P = .92) for LRF, (HR, 1.1; P = .94) axillary failure, and (HR, 0.4; P = .01) distant metastasis. 
> 
>## CONCLUSION: 
>Routine reporting of axillary tissue involvement, beyond LNs and ECE, is crucial in predicting breast cancer outcomes. Ruling out the presence of AXT is imperative before any form of axillary de-escalation, especially RLNR omission.

# Notes

| 10y | LN+ | LN+ ECE | LN+ AXT | LN+ ECE AXT |
| --- | --- | ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| DM  | 13  | 23      | 23      | 42          |
| AxF | 1.6 | 0.8     | 4.6     | 4.5         |
| LRF | 6.2 | 5.7     | 10      | 14          |

- MV: ACT -> DM (HR 1.6), LRF (HR 2.3), AxF (HR 3.3)
- with RT, SLNbx still okay even with AXT and ECE
- would be interesting to look at MR correlates (but may note be relevant as they all get some kind of surgical staging)
