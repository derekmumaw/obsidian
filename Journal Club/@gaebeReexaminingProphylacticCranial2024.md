# Abstract
## Background
Patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are at high risk for brain metastases. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is recommended in this population to reduce the incidence of brain metastases and prolong survival. We aimed to assesses the efficacy of PCI in this population in the era of routine brain imaging. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the use among patients who were radiographically confirmed not to have brain metastases after completion of first-line therapy.

## Methods
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, cohort studies and controlled trials reporting on the use of PCI for patients SCLC were identified in EMBASE, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and grey literature sources. The literature search was conducted on November 12, 2023. Summary data were extracted. Random-effects meta-analyses pooled hazard ratios (HR) for the primary outcome of overall survival between PCI and no intervention groups. This study is registered with the Open Science Framework, DOI:10.17605/OSF.IO/BC359, and PROSPERO, CRD42021249466.

## Findings
Of 4318 identified records, 223 were eligible for inclusion. 109 reported on overall survival in formats amenable to meta-analysis; PCI was associated with longer survival in all patients with SCLC (HR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.55–0.63; p < 0.001; n = 56,770 patients), patients with limited stage disease (HR 0.60; 95% CI, 0.55–0.65; p < 0.001; n = 78 studies; n = 27,137 patients), and patients with extensive stage disease (HR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.51–0.70; p < 0.001; n = 28 studies; n = 26,467 patients). Between-study heterogeneity was significant when pooled amongst all studies (I2 = 73.6%; 95% CI 68.4%–77.9%). Subgroup analysis did not reveal sources of heterogeneity. In a subgroup analysis on studies that used magnetic resonance imaging to exclude presence of brain metastases at restaging among all patients, overall survival did not differ significantly between patients who did or did not receive PCI (HR 0.74; 95% CI, 0.52–1.05; p = 0.08; n = 9 studies; n = 1384 patients).

## Interpretation
Our findings suggested that administration of PCI is associated with a survival benefit, but not when considering studies that radiographically confirmed absence of brain metastases, suggesting that the survival benefit conferred by PCI might be therapeutic rather than prophylactic. Funding No funding.

# Notes
- I'll be presenting "Re-examining prophylactic cranial irradiation in small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis." By Gaebe et al out of Toronto that was just published in the Lancet
## Introduction
- So here's the problem:
	- brain metastases are bad. MS 3-6 months
	- 15% of patients with SCLC present with brain metastases. >50% will develop brain metastases within two years.
- the solution: PCI?
	- Historically, PCI was given as it just made sense…and we had data to back it up. 
		- For example, Slotman showed a doubling in OS and intracranial metastases cut in third and the classic Auperin meta-analysis showed a 5% increase in OS and intracranial metastases cut in half.
- the counterpoints:
	- PCI is not free; it comes with an increase in toxicity and, perhaps more importantly…
	- Modern imaging surveillance is much more effective and studies show it cutting into the historical survival advantage 
		- Takahashi showed that with MRI screening, the OS advantage disappeared
	- at the present, PCI is an option for both limited and extensive stage, but it's encouraged for limited and discouraged for extensive. 
- this article provides a modern systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the role for PCI nowadays.

## Methods

- the search term was:
`("small cell lung cancer" or "small-cell lung cancer" or "small-cell lung carcinoma" or "small cell lung carcinoma" or "SCLC") and (("prophyla*" and ("crani*" or "intracrani*" or "brain" or "CNS") and ("radiation" or "irradiation" or "radiotherapy")) or "PCI")`
- which they fed into MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, as well as the _grey literature_
	- which was a term I had never heard before. Apparently that means "basically anything else they could find that looked somewhat reputable"
- … and then, after review, ultimately ended up with 223 studies in total with 74k patients where PCI was compared with surveillance.
	- the vast majority, like 90%, were retrospective reviews, but 24 were prospective, of which, 13 were randomized controlled trials.
- Of note, this is technically study-level, not patient-level, but they did make an effort to approximate patient-level data by extracting them from digitized KM curves.
- for analysis, OS was the primary outcome, but they also looked at—in order of increasing name length—
	- disease free survival
	- time-to-brain metastases
	- incidence of brain metastases
	- progression free survival time
	- brain metastasis free survival time
	- incidence of brain metastases as first site of recurrence

## Results
### Overall Survival
- They presented the analysis in this giant forest plot which is hard to see, so I just stripped out just the summary statistics stratified by disease stage, and the overall effect.
- For all commers, a Hazard ratio of 0.59 provides a pretty compelling case for the use of PCI. This is true for both limited and extensive stage disease which had HR of 0.59 and 0.60, respectively.
- The question that, I suppose, is on everyone's mind is "but wait! You haven't considered MRI! These results are meaningless because you haven't excluded all those patients who had active intracranial disease at the time of "prophylactic cranial irradiation!". Well, our friends from Toronto anticipated this.
	- They restricted the analysis to just those studies that used MRI to better stage the patient, and, sure enough, the Hazard Ratio rises a bit to 0.74, but this still favors PCI. However, by doing this you drop a large number of the studies, leaving you with 1384 patients in 9 studies which just isn't enough power to get that p below the magic 0.05 threshold. The p was 0.08, a strong trend.
- They also did a subgroup analysis, both for the whole cohort as well as by limited and extensive stage. There's a lot of data here, but the upshot to it all is that there weren't any sources of heterogeneity.
	- You do see a recapitulation of the MRI findings.
- They also looked at publication year, study sample size, and median age of participants without any significant change to heterogeneity (though publication year was close at p=0.09)
- Here's a funnel plot which looks pretty good.
- They looked at individual study bias risk and found that the RCTs were 'eh', but the retrospective studies were mostly "poor"
- However, looking back at that subgroup analysis table, you see that regardless of bias rating, they all seemed to show roughly the same level of effect

### Incidence of Brain Metastases
- So they did all those same analyses for all the secondary outcomes.
- For brain metastases incidence, we see that, unsurprisingly, it's less with PCI, in this case with a HR of 0.45. With MRI-screened patients, and this time, it was significant with a HR of 0.51 at p=0.047.

### Intracranial PFS
- here's intracranial progression free survival.
- Again, it favors PCI with an even stronger HR of 0.37.
- Interestingly, on the subgroup analysis, MRI staging didn't seem to have much of an effect on this, though the power was quite low.

### PFS
- Below it is regular-ol'PFS which, again, favors PCI with HR of 0.58. Even more interestingly, though MRI staging obviated this effect (but not the intracranial)

### DFS
- DFS, boringly, at this point favors PCI with a HR of 0.57.

### Intracranial Metastatic Disease as First Recurrence
- finally, we have intracranial metastatic disease as first recurrence.
- Any guesses? yeah, it also favors PCI with a HR of 0.44.

## Discussion
- are you ready for discussion? I sure am.
- The 30,000 foot interpretation the authors provide is that the PCI leads to better OS and a reduced incidence of brain metastases, regardless of stage.
- They immediately mention the elephant-sized magnet in the room, the effect of MRI staging. In that setting, PCI still reduced the incidence of brain mts, but did not have a significant effect on OS.
- They mention that there is no cost difference between MRI surveillance and PCI and so, given the rough equivalence, surveillance is a reasonable approach especially as SRS is increasingly being used, rather than Whole Brain.
- If there isn't easy access to MRIs, then the authors would favor routine PCI, in light of their findings.
- They made note that the incidence of intracranial mets didn't translate (at least in terms of significance) to overall survival which they suggested indicates that intracranial disease isn't the primary driver of mortality
	- this is definitely affected by the fact that patients who get PCI are a pre-selected population who has already had a response to systemic therapy.

### Limitations
- vast majority of studies were retrospective with poor quality. They do note that retrospective data isn't "evil" and actually does let us somewhat generalize to real-world practices.
- Of course, this also means there's a ton of heterogeneity in just about every aspect of trial design, but they weren't able to identify a specific source.
- They also noted that there's not a whole lot of MRI-screened PCI data as of yet, but there are like 5 ongoing trials looking at this.
- Finally, they weren't able to collect toxicity data which, as the survival benefit is in question, is incredibly important.

### Summary
- PCI was associated with improved survival and reduced brain metastases, regardless of stage, but significance of the survival benefit disappears in the MRI-screened population.
- This suggests that the survival benefit of PCI is therapeutic rather than prophylactic and should not necessarily be the default option in the context of modern MR imaging.
