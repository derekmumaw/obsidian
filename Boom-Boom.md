# Study
## 109 pts/304 Sites
- indolent NHL
- symptomatic, recurrent sites
- Failed systemic
- 90% G1-2 FL.
- ~50% bulky (≥ 5 cm).

## Treatment
- 4 Gy/1-2 fx
- RT with 1.5 cm margins

# Results
- ORR 92% (61 CR + 31 PR)
    - As retreatment: 98% (70% CR + 30% PR)
		- selection bias: only offered to those who responded initially.
- Clinical response within 10d
- Median TTP 14 mo, median TTLocP 25 mo.
- CR: TTP 25 mo and TTLocP 42 mo.
- PR: TTP and TTLocP equivalent at 10 mo
	- more likely to fail locally with PR.
- Probability of no progression at 1/2/3/5y of 40→ 33→ 25→ 10%.
- Nearly 10% of patients transformed to DLBCL.
	- Transformation to DLBCL: median TTP only 3 mo regardless of CR or not.

>[!summary]
> 100 patients with recurrent indolent NHL refractory to systemic therapy were treated with 4 Gy in 1-2 fractions.
> Results were quite good with 60% CR with a 4 year TTLocP and 30% PR with a 1 year TTLocP which makes this a very reasonable palliative treatment option.
> [[FORT (24 v 4)]] compares this to [[UK Multicenter (Dose-reduction)]] more directly
Short course RT for palliation of stage III-IV follicular lymphoma has favorable outcomes.
