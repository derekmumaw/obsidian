# Abstract

## BACKGROUND
Metal artifacts due to spinal implants may affect the accuracy of dose calculation for radiotherapy. However, the dosimetric impact of metal artifact reduction (MAR) for spinal implants in stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) plans has not been well studied. The objective of this study was to evaluate the dosimetric impact of MAR in spinal SBRT planning with three clinically common dose calculation algorithms.

## METHODS
Gammex phantom and 10 patients' computed tomography (CT) images were studied to investigate the effects of titanium implants. A commercial orthopedic MAR algorithm was employed to reduce artifacts. Dose calculations for SBRT were conducted on both artifact-corrected and uncorrected images using three commercial algorithms [analytical anisotropic algorithm (AAA), Acuros XB (AXB), and Monte Carlo (MC)]. Dose discrepancies between artifact-corrected and uncorrected cases were appraised using a dose-volume histogram (DVH) and 3-dimensional (3D) gamma analysis with different distance to agreement (DTA) and dose difference criteria. The gamma agreement index (GAI) was denoted as G(∆D, DTA). Statistical analysis of t-test was utilized to evaluate the dose differences of different algorithms.

## RESULTS
The phantom study demonstrated that titanium metal artifacts can be effectively reduced. The patient cases study showed that dose differences between the artifact-corrected and uncorrected datasets were small evaluated by gamma index and DVH. Gamma analysis found that even the strict criterion local G(1,1) had average values ≥93.9% for the three algorithms. For all DVH metrics, average differences did not exceed 0.7% in planning target volume (PTV) and 2.1% in planning risk volume of spinal cord (PRV-SC). Statistical analysis showed that the observed dose differences of MC method were significantly larger than those of AAA (P<0.01 for D98% of PTV and P<0.001 for D0.1cc of spinal cord) and AXB methods (P<0.001 for D98% and P<0.0001 for D0.1cc).

## CONCLUSIONS
Dosimetric impact of artifacts caused by titanium implants is not significant in spinal SBRT planning, which indicates that dose calculation algorithms might not be very sensitive to CT number variation caused by titanium inserts.
