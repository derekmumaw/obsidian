# Abstract
Bone metastases commonly occur in conjunction with solid tumors, and are associated with serious bone complications. Population-based estimates of bone metastasis incidence are limited, often based on autopsy data, and may not reflect current treatment patterns.

# Notes
- 5% annual incidence of bone metastases.
