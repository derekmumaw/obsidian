[Qualitative Assessment of Titanium versus Carbon Fiber/Polyetheretherketone Pedicle Screw-Related Artifacts: A Cadaveric Study.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35803562/)

# Abstract
## BACKGROUND
Dorsal instrumentation and decompression are the mainstays of spinal tumor treatment. Replacing titanium screws with carbon fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketone (CFRP) screws can reduce imaging artifacts on neural structures and perturbations of radiation dose. Further reduction of metal content in such screws might enhance the benefit. The aim of this study was to assess the artifacts produced by all-titanium screws (Ti-Ti), CFRP thread-titanium screw heads (C-Ti), and all-CFRP screws (C-C).

## METHODS
A cadaveric spine was used to place Ti-Ti, C-Ti, and C-C consecutively from T2 to S1. Computed tomography and 1.5T and 3T magnetic resonance imaging were performed for each screw system. Axial T1and T2-weighted sequences of representative thoracic and lumbar regions were assessed for artifacts. The artifacts were classified as not relevant, considerable, or severe.

## RESULTS
We evaluated 92 screws and made 178 artifact assessments. The artifacts were clearly visible in computed tomography scans but did not influence the visualization of intraspinal structures. Severe magnetic resonance imaging artifacts were found in 28% (17/60, mostly in the thoracic spine) of Ti-Ti, 2% (1/60, all T1 sequences) of C-Ti, and 0% of C-C, and considerable artifacts were found in 47% (28/60) of Ti-Ti, 10% (6/60, only 1 T2 sequence) of C-Ti, and 0% of C-C screws (P < 0.001).

## CONCLUSIONS
CFRP pedicle screws reduced the artifact intensity in spinal structures compared with titanium screws, and may be beneficial for planning radiotherapy and for follow-up imaging. C-C demonstrated an enhanced effect on dorsal structures.
