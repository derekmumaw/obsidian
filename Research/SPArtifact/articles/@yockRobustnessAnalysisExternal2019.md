# Abstract
In external beam radiotherapy, uncertainties in treatment planning and delivery can result in an undesirable dose distribution delivered to the patient that can compromise the benefit of treatment. Techniques including geometric margins and probabilistic optimization have been used effectively to mitigate the effects of uncertainties. However, their broad application is inconsistent which can compromise the conclusions derived from cross-technique and cross-modality comparisons. This report describes robustness analysis as a framework that is applicable across treatment techniques and modalities. It identifies elements that are imperative to include when conducting robustness analysis and describing uncertainties and their dosimetric effects. The purpose of this more consistent approach to robustness analysis is to promote reliable plan evaluation and dose reporting, particularly during clinical trials conducted across institutions and treatment modalities., Uncertainties in radiotherapy treatment planning and treatment delivery compromise the integrity of the desired dose distribution. Appropriate consideration of these uncertainties will improve the description of the delivered dose as well as our understanding of their clinical impact. This article identifies the elements required for a precise, unambiguous description of uncertainties and of their dosimetric effects.
