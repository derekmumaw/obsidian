# Abstract
Investigators found that although many institutional review boards advise researchers to write informed-consent forms at an 8th-grade reading level, the sample forms they provide are often written above the 10th-grade level. Readability was not associated with local rates of literacy. Educational materials for patients and informed-consent documents present highly complex information that must be understood by patients.1–3 This complexity is a major barrier to comprehension for the approximately one quarter of American adults with low literacy skills.4 A low level of literacy is independently associated with poor health outcomes and billions of dollars of additional annual health care expenditures.5–9 When documents are incomprehensible, health care providers may risk liability.10–12 Obtaining informed consent for participation in medical research is particularly challenging because it requires a level of comprehension beyond that required for consent to usual care.13 A large . . .
