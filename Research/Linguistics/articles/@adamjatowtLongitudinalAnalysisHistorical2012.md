# Abstract
Digital libraries often contain historical documents of varying age. The degree to which users can understand their content depends much on their reading difficulty. In this poster paper we report the results of our studies on the readability of historical documents from the viewpoint of present users. We investigate the correlation between the outcomes of different readability measurements and publication dates of prose texts on the basis of two datasets, the Victorian Women's Writers Project and the Corpus of Late Modern English Texts.
