# Abstract

## BACKGROUND
The purpose of this clinical trial was to compare efficacy and safety of the Boswellia serrata extract H15 with mesalazine for the treatment of active Crohn's disease.

## PATIENTS AND METHODS
Randomised, double-blind, verum-controlled, parallel group comparison for which 102 Patients were randomised. The per protocol population included 44 patients treated with H15 and 39 patients treated with mesalazine. As primary outcome measure the change of the Crohn Disease Activity Index (CDAI) between the status of enrolment and end of therapy was chosen. H 15 was tested on non-inferiority compared to standard treatment with mesalazine.

## RESULTS
The CDAI between the status of enrolment and end of therapy after treatment with H15 was reduced by 90 and after therapy with mesalazine by 53 scores in the mean. In this non-inferiority-trial the test hypothesis was confirmed by the statistical analysis. The difference between both treatments could not be proven to be statistically significant in favor to H15 for the primary outcome measure. The secondary efficacy endpoints confirm the assessment of the comparison of H15 and mesalazine. The proven tolerability of H15 completes the results of the shown clinical efficacy.

## CONCLUSIONS
The study confirms that therapy with H15 is not inferior to mesalazine. This can be interpreted as evidence for the efficacy of H15 according to the state of art in the treatment of active Crohn's disease with Boswellia serrata extract, since the efficacy of mesalazine for this indication has been approved by the health authorities. Considering both safety and efficacy of Boswellia serrata extract H15 it appears to be superior over mesalazine in terms of a benefit-risk-evaluation.

# Notes
- double blind Non-inferiority RCT
- 83 patients randomized 1:1 to BS or mesalazine
- H15 non-inferior to mesalazine with regards to Crohn Disease Activity Index (and with better safety profile!)
