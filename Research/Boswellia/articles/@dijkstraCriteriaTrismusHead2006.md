# Abstract
## Purpose
The aim of this study was to determine a functional cut-off point for trismus in head and neck oncology.

## Methods
In total, 89 patients (13 dentate, 30 partially dentate and 46 edentulous) treated for cancer of the oral cavity or oropharynx were asked whether they experienced a limited mouth opening. The mandibular function impairment questionnaire (MFIQ) was filled out and mouth opening was measured. The proportion correctly predicted (proportion true positives+proportion true negatives) was calculated. For cut-off points from 25 to 45mm, differences in MFIQ scores of the restricted and non-restricted groups were analyzed. A receiver operating curve was constructed.

## Results
The proportion correctly predicted was highest for cut-off point ≤35mm (0.81), with a sensitivity of 0.71 and a specificity of 0.98. Differences in perceived mandibular function impairments were significant for all cut-off points of 35mm or less. For the total group, the area under curve was 0.87. For the subgroups of dentate, partially dentate and edentulous patients, no consistent cut-off points could be found on the basis of the proportion correctly predicted and the significance of the difference in MFIQ scores.

## Conclusion
A mouth opening of ≤35mm is a functional cut-off point for trismus in head and neck oncology patients.
