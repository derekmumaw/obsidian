# Abstract
## Purpose
To evaluate the therapeutic effect of rehabilitation therapy on radiation-induced dysphagia and trismus in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients after radiotherapy.

## Patients and Methods
43 NPC patients after radiotherapy were included. Patients were randomly assigned to either the rehabilitation group or a control group. Both groups were subjected to routine treatment, while the rehabilitation group also received rehabilitation therapy for 3 months. The severity of dysphagia was assessed using the water swallow test, while trismus was evaluated with the LENT/SOMA score and the interincisor distance (IID). The water swallow test, the LENT/SOMA score, as well as IID for both groups before and after treatment were analyzed and compared.

## Results
After treatment, the rehabilitation group displayed a significant improvement in swallowing function, while the control group did not. The efficacy rate (percentage of patients with excellent or effective results) of rehabilitation group was higher than that of control group (77% vs. 43%), and the difference was statistically significant (ϰ2 = 5.32, p = 0.02). IID pretreatment and posttreatment did not show much difference in the rehabilitation group, while in the control group IID significantly decreased posttreatment (1.1 ± 0.36 cm vs.1.8 ± 0.56 cm, p = 0.001). Although the mean IID in patients of both groups decreased after the 3 month follow-up, the decrease in the rehabilitation group was less than that of the control group (0.19 ± 0.5 cm vs. 0.69 ± 0.56 cm, p = 0.004 ). The efficacy rate of trismus in the rehabilitation group was significantly higher than that of the control group (64% vs. 28%, ϰ2 = 5.31, p = 0.02).

## Conclusions
Rehabilitation training can improve swallow function and slow down the progress of trismus in NPC patients following radiotherapy.
