# Abstract
## Purpose
Osteoarthritis is a common, chronic, progressive, skeletal, degenerative disorder, which commonly affects the knee joint. Boswellia serrata tree is commonly found in India. The therapeutic value of its gum (guggulu) has been known. It posses good anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritic and analgesic activity.

## Methods
A randomized double blind placebo controlled crossover study was conducted to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Boswellia serrata Extract (BSE) in 30 patients of osteoarthritis of knee, 15 each receiving active drug or placebo for eight weeks. After the first intervention, washout was given and then the groups were crossed over to receive the opposite intervention for eight weeks.

## Results
All patients receiving drug treatment reported decrease in knee pain, increased knee flexion and increased walking distance. The frequency of swelling in the knee joint was decreased. Radiologically there was no change. The observed differences between drug treated and placebo being statistically significant, are clinically relevant. BSE was well tolerated by the subjects except for minor gastrointestinal ADRs.

## Conclusions
BSE is recommended in the patients of osteoarthritisosteoarthritis of the knee with possible therapeutic use in other arthritis.

# Notes
- double-blind crossover RCT. 
- 30 patients 1:1. ±BS x8wks → crossover for 8wks
- 3-point scale. Significant reductions in pain, loss of movement, swelling greater than with placebo
