# Abstract

## Background
The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of structured exercise with jaw mobilizing devices on trismus and its effect on trismus symptomatology and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in head and neck (H&N) cancer patients.

## Material and Methods
Fifty patients with H&N cancer and trismus, i.e. maximum interincisal opening (MIO) ≤ 35 mm participated in a structured intervention program with jaw exercise. The patients in the intervention group underwent a 10-week exercise program with regular follow-up. A control group comprising of 50 patients with trismus and H&N cancer were matched to the intervention group according to gender, tumor location, tumor stage, comorbidity and age. HRQL and trismus-related symptoms were assessed.

## Results
The mean MIO improvement was 6.4 mm (4.8–8.0) and 0.7 (−0.3–1.7) mm in the intervention group and control group respectively, three months post-intervention commencement (p < 0.001). The intervention group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in Role functioning, Social functioning and Global quality of life (EORTC QLQ C30) and in all Gothenburg Trismus Questionnaire (GTQ) domains, i.e. jaw-related problems (p < 0.001), eating limitation (p < 0.05) and muscular tension (p < 0.001).

## Conclusion
We found that a structured jaw exercise program was effective and improved the mouth opening capacity significantly. The objective effect on trismus (MIO) was also reflected in the patient-reported outcome questionnaires where the patients who underwent the structured exercise program after cancer treatment reported improvements in HRQL and less trismus-related symptoms compared to the control group.
