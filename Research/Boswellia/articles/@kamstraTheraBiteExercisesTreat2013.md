# Abstract

## Purpose
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of TheraBite exercises on mouth opening and to analyze factors influencing this effect in a patient record evaluation.

## Methods
Effect of exercises with a TheraBite to treat trismus was evaluated in 69 head and neck cancer patients of two university medical centers. Mouth opening was measured as interincisal distance in millimeters. Patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics were analyzed for their relationship with change in mouth opening. Variables univariately associated (p ≤ 0.05) with change in mouth opening were entered in a logistic regression analysis as possible predictors for an increase in mouth opening of the smallest detectable difference of 5 mm or more.

## Results
Mean initial mouth opening was 22.0 mm (SD 6.4); mean increase in mouth opening was 5.4 mm (SD 5.7). “Chemotherapy”, “medical center”, and “time from oncological treatment to start exercises” were significantly associated with an increase in mouth opening. In the logistic regression analysis, “medical center” (β = 1.97) and “time from oncological treatment to start exercises” reduced the odds of reaching an increase in mouth opening of 5 mm or more, β = −0.11 per month.

## Conclusions
After TheraBite exercises, mouth opening increased averagely with 5.4 mm. The odds of an increase in mouth opening of 5 mm or more reduces if the time from oncological treatment to start exercises lengthens, corrected for the effect of medical center.
