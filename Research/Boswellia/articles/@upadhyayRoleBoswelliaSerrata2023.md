# Abstract
Radiation necrosis (RN) is a concerning late toxicity after radiation therapy for brain metastases. The management of RN primarily depends on the extent of edema on imaging and presence of symptoms. Oral corticosteroids are the mainstay of management; however, they are not optimal for long-term management because of multiple side effects and drug interactions. Boswellia serrata is an extract derived from Indian frankincense, which is available as an over-the-counter supplement, and has been traditionally used in the treatment of asthma, arthritis and colitis due to its anti-inflammatory properties. Recent data have reported the benefits of Boswellia on reducing cerebral edema. We discuss a case report involving a patient with brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery who developed early RN and had a good response with resolution of postradiation edema with the use of Boswellia.

# Notes
## Case
- left frontal lobe met, s/p SRS 24/3 VMAT
- MRI @2m: partial response but increased G1 radiation induced edema
- started Boswellia Serrata 4.2-4.5 g qD
	- 3x1200 mg + 2x450 mg in 3 divided doses
	- Side effects: mild fatigue
- MRI @5m, 8m: >90% improvement in FLAIR enhancement/edema

## Discussion
- aka: Indian frankincense
- traditional use: asthma, arthritis, colitis
- no side effects, allows reduction in steroid use (which does have side effects)
