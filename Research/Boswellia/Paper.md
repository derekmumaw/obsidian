## Introduction
### Trismus Definition and Impact
Trismus is a pathologic restriction in jaw opening, defined as an opening of less than or equal to 35 mm [^@dijkstraCriteriaTrismusHead2006], typically caused by fibrosis following surgery and/or radiation, or—more rarely—as a result of direct tumor involvement of the masticatory muscles. It is a common problem in head and neck cancer treatment: approximately 50% of patients who undergo definitive treatment involving radiation therapy will meet the Djikstra definition for trismus[^@weberLimitedMouthOpening2010][^@louisekentRadiationInducedTrismusHead2008]; oropharyngeal disease is particularly prone with nearly 2/3rds meeting the definition [^@weberLimitedMouthOpening2010]. A meta-analysis [^@wattersPrevalenceTrismusPatients2019] noted a 44% prevalence at 6 months falling to 32% at 12 months and remaining stable thereafter.  Not only is trismus common, it also substantially degrades quality of life with significant detriments to mouth opening, chewing, food intake, and overall quality of life [^@louisekentRadiationInducedTrismusHead2008].

### Existing Therapies and Effectiveness
There are a number of management options for patients experiencing trismus. Perhaps most important is physical therapy which plays an integral role in the management of trismus with interventions including both passive and active range of motion exercises as well as electrotherapy. Passive range of motion exercises are often performed using devices which provide a controlled opening force to the jaw. These can be ad-hoc—as in stacked tongue depressors or wooden spatulas[^@shulmanTreatingTrismusDynamic2008][^@leeRandomisedFeasibilityStudy2018]—or commercially produced—such as the Therabite® and Dynasplint® systems.

The effectiveness of these commercially produced devices in reducing trismus has been assessed in a number of studies. The literature regarding Dynasplint® has shown overall effect sizes ranging from 7 mm  [^@stubblefieldPreliminaryReportEfficacy2010] to 13.6 mm [^@shulmanTreatingTrismusDynamic2008] of increased jaw opening with a rate of change estimate of 0.36 mm per day[^@barananoDynasplintManagementTrismus2011]. Regarding Therabite®, Sherpenhuizen et al. [^@scherpenhuizenEffectExerciseTherapy2015] performed a systematic review which identified 4 studies assessing the impact of this device on radiotherapy-induced trismus. Kamstra et al. [^@kamstraTheraBiteExercisesTreat2013] identified a 5.4 mm mean increase and Tang et al. [^@tangRandomizedProspectiveStudy2011] showed a net mean benefit of 5 mm. Of particular interest are Buchbinder et al. [^@buchbinderMobilizationRegimensPrevention1993] and Pauli et al. [^@pauliExerciseInterventionTreatment2014] which also report the duration of Therabite® treatment allowing for a calculation of rate of improvement:  0.19 mm/day and 0.09 mm/day, respectively.

Some systemic therapies have shown promise in augmenting physical therapy and device-based interventions, notably pentoxifylline which has been shown to exert only a modest benefit with a mean improvement of 4 mm [^@chuaPilotStudyPentoxifylline2001]. Botulinum toxin has also been tested, and, though it was found to improve pain and masticator spasms, it provides no direct benefit to jaw opening[^@danaBotulinumToxinRadiationinduced2008]. Despite all of these therapeutic modalities, trismus treatment remains characterized by slow, modest gains.

### Boswellia
_Boswellia serrata_ (_BS_) is a tree native to North Africa, the Middle East, and India[^@siddiquiBoswelliaSerrataPotential2011]. It produces a natural resin known colloquially as 'Indian frankincense' and '_salai_' which has long been used as an incense and aromatic. It also has found use in traditional Ayurvedic medicine where it is considered to be an effective antirheumatic agent. The resin is a complex amalgam of molecules but uniquely contains pentacyclic triterpenic acids known as '_boswellic acids_'[^@safayhiBoswellicAcidsNovel1992]. These molecules have been found to have anti-inflammatory properties through their inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase, human leukocyte elastase, TNF-alpha, interleukin-1beta, NFKB, VEGF, and TGF-beta [^@poeckelBoswellicAcidsBiological2006][^@gayathriPureCompoundBoswellia2007][^@safayhiInhibitionBoswellicAcids1997][^@lulliAcetyl11ketovboswellicAcidReduces2015][^@shangAcetyl11KetovBoswellicAcidAttenuates2016][^@sferraBoswelliaSerrataSalvia2012].

These _in vitro_ anti-inflammatory effects have translated to _in vivo_ benefits. One of the first studies was in asthma: Gupta et al. [^@guptaEffectsBoswelliaSerrata1998]performed a double-blind, randomized controlled trial where _BS_ was shown to result in 70% symptomatic improvement compared to 27% in the control arm. Gerhardt et al. [^@gerhardtTherapyActiveCrohn2001] showed _BS_ to be non-inferior to mesalazine in Crohn's disease and Madisch et al. [^@madischBoswelliaSerrataExtract2007] showed an absolute 37% increase in the rate of clinical remission of collagenous colitis. Kimmatkar et al.[^@kimmatkarEfficacyTolerabilityBoswellia2003] and Thawani et al. [^@thawaniOpenRandomizedControlled2007] both performed randomized controlled trials of _BS_ in osteoarthritis and found improvements in pain, movement, swelling, and ability to accomplish activities of daily living. Most recently, there has been a surge of interest in _BS_ in the setting of post-radiation edema following partial-brain and whole-brain radiation therapy. Retrospective reviews, case reports, and case series have documented a substantial reduction in cerebral edema with _BS_ [^@RoleBoswelliaSerrata][^@warnickTreatmentAdverseRadiation2023][^@dipierroNovelLecithinbasedDelivery2019]. Kirste et al. [^@kirsteBoswelliaSerrataActs2011] performed a randomized controlled trial which demonstrated a >75% reduction in cerebral edema in 60% of patients receiving _BS_ (compared to only 26% receiving placebo).

In these studies, toxicity of _BS_ was minimal and mild. None of the studies discussed report any serious adverse event. Most reported mild non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms: Madisch et al. reported one patient (6.25%) with mild dizziness, hypoglycemia, and lack of appetite and another who developed persistent diarrhea and bacterial enteritis[^@madischBoswelliaSerrataExtract2007]; Kimmatkar et al. reported one patient (3%) with loose bowel movements and another developed epigastric pain and nausea[^@kimmatkarEfficacyTolerabilityBoswellia2003]; Thawani et al. reported one patient (3%) with diarrhea and abdominal cramps and three patients with reflux [^@thawaniOpenRandomizedControlled2007]; finally, Kirste et al. reported 6 patients (27%) with grade 1-2 diarrhea.

To our knowledge, there have been no reports documenting the use of _BS_ in treating trismus. Herein, we provide a case report of _BS_ augmenting passive range of motion interventions leading to the rapid resolution of the patient's trismus.

# Case Presentation

Our patient is a 54 year old previously-healthy male with no relevant past medical history. He had a 2 pack-year smoking history from 1990-2013 (~3-4 cigarettes per day) followed by weekly cigar use until 2020 at which point it became daily. He initially presented with discomfort and a sensation of fullness in the right posterlateral oropharynx with mild right-sided trismus. This prompted referral to an oral surgeon who ordered a contrast-enhanced CT of the neck showing a 4.2 cm homogeneously-enhancing mass of the right palatine tonsil abutting the pterygoid musculature—there was no evidence of any regional nodal disease. He was referred to an otolaryngologist who performed a biopsy revealing p16-positive squamous cell carcinoma. A staging PET/CT was then performed, demonstrating FDG-avidity of the biopsy-proven right tonsillar mass which extended inferiorly, effacing the right vallecula. There was no evidence of FDG-avid regional or distant disease. His imaging is shown in Figure 1.

![[dx_imaging.png]]

For this, the patient underwent definitive chemoradiation therapy with 70 Gy(RBE) delivered to gross disease, 63 Gy(RBE) to high-risk surrounding tissue, and 56 Gy(RBE) of elective bilateral nodal irradiation (levels II-IV) all in 35 fractions via a simultaneous integrated boost as depicted in Figure 2. Protons were used to minimize toxicity in the setting of bilateral elective neck treatment. Weekly cisplatin was administered concurrently. Treatment was completed in 50 days without any unanticipated complications or significant delays. A single replan was required due to tumor response and weight loss noted on cone beam CT. The patient experienced expected mild-moderate fatigue, mucositis, odynophagia, and dermatitis during his course of treatment.

At the time of the patient's 3-month post-treatment follow up, he noted the development of mild bilateral cervical and submental lymphedema; however, much of the acute, treatment-related side effects had resolved with only mild dysgeusia and mild trismus (22 mm) remaining. Over the course of the following 3 weeks, the patient's trismus dramatically worsened, nadiring at 4-6 mm. Passive range of motion exercises using a custom-made tongue depressor fulcrum device were started at this point with minimal improvement. The patient met with his otolaryngologist who recommended referral for coronoidectomy. Motivated by a desire to avoid surgery, the patient began treatment with the Therabite® system. Two days later, the patient began treatment with _Boswellia serrata_ (4.5 grams per day).

![[BS_graph.png#invert]]

The treatment response is documented in Figure 3 with day -21 representing his jaw-opening nadir, day 0 his initiation of Therabite®, day 2 his initiation of  _BS_, and the subsequent improvement thereafter with records ending at day 41. At that point, he had achieved a net improvement in jaw opening of 27 mm, consistent with a 0.61 mm/day rate of improvement. Within 1 week of starting  _BS_ , the patient also noted resolution of his cervical/submental lymphedema, gingival edema, and improvement in his chronic bilateral knee osteoarthritis which was sustained at the time of his 5-month post-treatment follow up visit (the most recent encounter with the patient). The patient experienced no side effects which he could attribute to _BS_.

# Discussion

As described above, here we have a patient with severe trismus who, after initially struggling with passive range of motion exercises (achieving only 1-2 mm of opening), had a dramatic response to combination therapy with Therabite® and _Boswellia serrata_. Over the course of 41 days, the patient improved his jaw opening from 6 mm to 33 mm: an impressive gain of 27 mm or 0.61 mm/day.

This is far faster than that previously documented in the Therabite® literature: 6.6 times faster than the rate determined by Pauli et al. [^@pauliExerciseInterventionTreatment2014] and 3.1 times faster than Buchbinder et al. [^@buchbinderMobilizationRegimensPrevention1993]. Even the best-case scenario—the upper limit of Buchbinder's 95% confidence interval—is 2.5x lower than our patient. Our patient's rate of improvement lies an impressive 4.0 standard deviations above Buchbinder's mean (p<0.0001).

It seems difficult, then, to attribute the patient's rapid improvement solely to his use of the Therabite® system. Within 2 days of initiating Therabite®, the patient also began taking _Boswellia serrata_. As mentioned, _BS_ has a well-documented anti-inflammatory effect, with _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ studies both identifying several targets of activity including 5-lipoxygenase, human leukocyte elastase, TNF-alpha, interleukin-1beta, NFKB, VEGF, and TGF-beta [^@poeckelBoswellicAcidsBiological2006][^@gayathriPureCompoundBoswellia2007][^@safayhiInhibitionBoswellicAcids1997][^@lulliAcetyl11ketovboswellicAcidReduces2015][^@shangAcetyl11KetovBoswellicAcidAttenuates2016][^@sferraBoswelliaSerrataSalvia2012]. These molecular targets are of particular interest in the post-radiation setting in that they are known to mediate the continuous inflammatory state—caused by persistent oxidative stress and hypoxia—ultimately leading to  fibrosis [^@lin5LipoxygenaseInhibitorsAttenuate2014][^@fujinoAdministrationSpecificInhibitor2012][^@straubRadiationinducedFibrosisMechanisms2015][^@liuNFkBSignalingInflammation2017][^@shamsOverexpressionVEGFDermal2022] and necrosis [^@schaueCytokinesRadiobiologicalResponses2012]. TGF-beta has been specifically implicated in the etiopathogenesis of radiation-induced trismus by inducing myofibroblast differentiation and subsequently stimulating their secretion of collagen, fibronectin, and proteoglycans as well as by downregulating matrix metalloproteinase activity. Thus, the rate of extracellular matrix deposition is increased while its degradation is inhibited, leading to stiffening of tissue [^@rajEtiopathogenesisTrismusPatients2020]. Inhibition of these pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrotic pathways may be the mechanism through which _BS_ is augmenting the speed of the patient's recovery. 

We also see several other systemic effects that support this anti-inflammatory hypothesis. Within a week of initiating treatment with _BS_, the patient noted substantial improvement in his gingival edema, cervical lymphedema, and arthritic pain. These, of course, cannot be explained by the Therabite®, and the abruptness and concurrence of the recovery for each issue is inconsistent with a spontaneous resolution. This is, again, suggestive of a strong anti-inflammatory effect with _Boswellia serrata_.

When considering the added value of any new therapy, it is also important to consider its side effects. In the case of _Boswellia serrata_, there are no documented serious adverse effects in the literature, only mild gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea and diarrhea. This stands in contrast to the other available systemic agents for trismus: pentoxifylline is associated with gastrointestinal (discomfort, bloating, and diarrhea), neurologic (dizziness, headache), and cardiovascular (flushing, arrhythmias, etc.) side effects [^@annamarajuPentoxifylline2024] while botulinum toxin may cause injection-site pain, edema, erythema, ecchymosis, and hypo/hypesthesia as well as more serious side effects such as muscle spasms, headaches,  denervation, and dysphagia. Our case report suggests that _Boswellia serrata_ is both more effective and less side effect prone than these.

# Conclusion
Given the extremely detrimental effects of trismus on quality of life and the slow, modest gains effected by the current suite of treatments, there is an unmet need for additional therapies. We believe that _Boswellia serrata_ may meet this need—at least in part—as evidenced by our patient's dramatic recovery of jaw mobility. Though this is the first documented use in the setting of trismus, it is consistent with the literature which has reported promising results in several disease processes whilst carrying a minimal risk of mild side effects. Further studies are needed to explore the role of _Boswellia serrata_ for the treatment of trismus and prospective studies may be justified to quantify its benefit.
