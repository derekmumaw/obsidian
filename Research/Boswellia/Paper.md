## Introduction
### Trismus Definition and Impact
Trismus is a pathologic restriction in jaw opening, defined as less than or equal to 35 mm [^@dijkstraCriteriaTrismusHead2006]. It commonly results in patients with head and neck cancer due to direct involvement of the masticatory muscles or due to fibrosis following surgery and/or radiation. It is a common problem in this population: approximately 50% of patients with oropharyngeal malignancies who underwent definitive treatment involving radiation therapy met the Djikstra definition for trismus[^@weberLimitedMouthOpening2010][^@louisekentRadiationInducedTrismusHead2008]; oropharyngeal disease is particularly prone with nearly 2/3rds meeting the definition [^@weberLimitedMouthOpening2010]. Not only is trismus common, it also substantially degrades quality of life with significant reductions in difficulty with mouth opening, chewing, decreased food intake, and overall quality of life [^@louisekentRadiationInducedTrismusHead2008][^@scottFactorsAssociatedRestricted2008].

### Existing Therapies and Effectiveness
There are a number of management options for patients experiencing trismus as described in the Cochrane systematic review by Carvalho et al.[^@carvalhoInterventionsPreventingTreating2016]. Physical therapy plays an integral role in the management of trismus including both passive and active range of motion exercises as well as electrotherapy. Passive range of motion exercise are often implemented with the aid of devices to provide a controlled opening force to the jaw, both ad-hoc—as in stacked tongue depressors or wooden spatulas[^@shulmanTreatingTrismusDynamic2008][^@leeRandomisedFeasibilityStudy2018]— and commercially produced, such as the Therabite® and Dynasplint® systems.

The effectiveness of these commercially produced devices in reducing trismus has been assessed in a number of studies. The literature regarding Dynasplint® has shown overall effect sizes ranging from 7 mm  [^@stubblefieldPreliminaryReportEfficacy2010] to 13.6 mm [^@shulmanTreatingTrismusDynamic2008] of increased jaw opening with a rate of change estimate of 0.36 mm per day[^@barananoDynasplintManagementTrismus2011]. For Therabite®, Sherpenhuizen et al. [^@scherpenhuizenEffectExerciseTherapy2015] performed a systematic review identifying 4 studies assessing the impact of this device on radiotherapy-induced trismus. Kamstra et al. [^@kamstraTheraBiteExercisesTreat2013] identified a 5.4 mm mean increase and Tang et al. [^@tangRandomizedProspectiveStudy2011] showed a net mean benefit of 5 mm. Of particular interest are Buchbinder et al. [^@buchbinderMobilizationRegimensPrevention1993] and Pauli et al. [^@pauliExerciseInterventionTreatment2014] which also report the duration of Therabite® treatment, allowing for a calculation of rate of change:  0.19 mm/day and 0.09 mm/day, respectively.

Some systemic therapies have shown some promise in augmenting physical therapy and device-based interventions, notably pentoxifylline which has been shown to exert a modest benefit with a mean improvement of 4 mm [^@chuaPilotStudyPentoxifylline2001]. Botulinum toxin has also been used, and though it has not been shown to improve trismus directly, has been found to improve pain and masticator spasms[^@danaBotulinumToxinRadiationinduced2008].

### Boswellia 
*Boswellia serrata* (BS) is a tree native to North Africa, the Middle East, and India[^@siddiquiBoswelliaSerrataPotential2011]. It produces a natural resin known colloquially as 'Indian frankincense' and '*salai*' which has long been used as incense and as an aromatic. The resin also has been used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine as an antirheumatic agent. The resin is a complex amalgam of molecules but uniquely contains pentacyclic triterpenic acids known as '*boswellic acids*'[^@safayhiBoswellicAcidsNovel1992]. These molecules have been found to have anti-inflammatory properties through their inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase, human leukocyte elastase, TNF-alpha, interleukin-1beta, NFKB, VEGF, and STAT3 [^@poeckelBoswellicAcidsBiological2006][^@gayathriPureCompoundBoswellia2007][^@safayhiInhibitionBoswellicAcids1997][^@lulliAcetyl11ketovboswellicAcidReduces2015]. 

These *in vitro* anti-inflammatory effects have translated to *in vivo* benefits. One of the first studies was of asthma where Gupta et al. [^@guptaEffectsBoswelliaSerrata1998]performed a double-blind, randomized controlled trial where BS was shown to result in 70% symptomatic improvement compared to 27% in the control arm. Gerhardt et al. [^@gerhardtTherapyActiveCrohn2001] showed BS to be non-inferior to mesalazine in Crohn's disease and Madisch et al. [^@madischBoswelliaSerrataExtract2007] showed an absolute 37% increase in rates of clinical remission with Collagenous colitis. Kimmatkar et al.[^@kimmatkarEfficacyTolerabilityBoswellia2003] and Thawani et al. [^@thawaniOpenRandomizedControlled2007] both performed randomized controlled trials of BS in osteoarthritis and found improvements in pain, movement, swelling, and ability to accomplish activities of daily living. Most recently, there has been a surge of interest in BS in the setting of post-radiation edema following partial-brain and whole-brain radiation therapy. Retrospective reviews, case reports, and case series have documented a substantial reduction in cerebral edema with BS [^@RoleBoswelliaSerrata][^@warnickTreatmentAdverseRadiation2023][^@dipierroNovelLecithinbasedDelivery2019]. Kirste et al. [^@kirsteBoswelliaSerrataActs2011] demonstrated a >75% reduction in cerebral edema in 60% of patients receiving BS (compared to only 26% receiving placebo). 

To our knowledge, there have been no reports documenting the use of BS in treating trismus. Herein, we provide a case report of a dramatic
