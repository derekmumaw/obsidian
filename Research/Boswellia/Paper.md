## Introduction
### Trismus Definition and Impact
Trismus is a pathologic restriction in jaw opening, defined as an opening of less than or equal to 35 mm [^@dijkstraCriteriaTrismusHead2006], typically caused by fibrosis following surgery and/or radiation, or—more rarely—as a result of direct tumor involvement of the masticatory muscles. It is a common problem in head and neck cancer treatment: approximately 50% of patients who undergo definitive treatment involving radiation therapy will meet the Djikstra definition for trismus[^@weberLimitedMouthOpening2010][^@louisekentRadiationInducedTrismusHead2008]; oropharyngeal disease is particularly prone with nearly 2/3rds meeting the definition [^@weberLimitedMouthOpening2010]. Not only is trismus common, it also substantially degrades quality of life with significant detriments to mouth opening, chewing, food intake, and overall quality of life [^@louisekentRadiationInducedTrismusHead2008][^@scottFactorsAssociatedRestricted2008].

### Existing Therapies and Effectiveness
There are a number of management options for patients experiencing trismus. Perhaps most important is physical therapy which plays an integral role in the management of trismus with interventions including both passive and active range of motion exercises as well as electrotherapy. Passive range of motion exercises are often performed using devices which provide a controlled opening force to the jaw. These can be ad-hoc—as in stacked tongue depressors or wooden spatulas[^@shulmanTreatingTrismusDynamic2008][^@leeRandomisedFeasibilityStudy2018]—or commercially produced—such as the Therabite® and Dynasplint® systems.

The effectiveness of these commercially produced devices in reducing trismus has been assessed in a number of studies. The literature regarding Dynasplint® has shown overall effect sizes ranging from 7 mm  [^@stubblefieldPreliminaryReportEfficacy2010] to 13.6 mm [^@shulmanTreatingTrismusDynamic2008] of increased jaw opening with a rate of change estimate of 0.36 mm per day[^@barananoDynasplintManagementTrismus2011]. Regarding Therabite®, Sherpenhuizen et al. [^@scherpenhuizenEffectExerciseTherapy2015] performed a systematic review which identified 4 studies assessing the impact of this device on radiotherapy-induced trismus. Kamstra et al. [^@kamstraTheraBiteExercisesTreat2013] identified a 5.4 mm mean increase and Tang et al. [^@tangRandomizedProspectiveStudy2011] showed a net mean benefit of 5 mm. Of particular interest are Buchbinder et al. [^@buchbinderMobilizationRegimensPrevention1993] and Pauli et al. [^@pauliExerciseInterventionTreatment2014] which also report the duration of Therabite® treatment allowing for a calculation of rate of change:  0.19 mm/day and 0.09 mm/day, respectively.

Some systemic therapies have shown promise in augmenting physical therapy and device-based interventions, notably pentoxifylline which has been shown to exert only a modest benefit with a mean improvement of 4 mm [^@chuaPilotStudyPentoxifylline2001]. Botulinum toxin has also been tested, and, though it was found to improve pain and masticator spasms, it provides no direct benefit to jaw opening[^@danaBotulinumToxinRadiationinduced2008]. Despite all of these therapeutic modalities, trismus treatment remains characterized by slow, modest gains.

### Boswellia
_Boswellia serrata_ (BS) is a tree native to North Africa, the Middle East, and India[^@siddiquiBoswelliaSerrataPotential2011]. It produces a natural resin known colloquially as 'Indian frankincense' and '_salai_' which has long been used as an incense and aromatic and has been used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine as an antirheumatic agent. The resin is a complex amalgam of molecules but uniquely contains pentacyclic triterpenic acids known as '_boswellic acids_'[^@safayhiBoswellicAcidsNovel1992]. These molecules have been found to have anti-inflammatory properties through their inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase, human leukocyte elastase, TNF-alpha, interleukin-1beta, NFKB, VEGF, and STAT3 [^@poeckelBoswellicAcidsBiological2006][^@gayathriPureCompoundBoswellia2007][^@safayhiInhibitionBoswellicAcids1997][^@lulliAcetyl11ketovboswellicAcidReduces2015].

These _in vitro_ anti-inflammatory effects have translated to _in vivo_ benefits. One of the first studies was of asthma: Gupta et al. [^@guptaEffectsBoswelliaSerrata1998]performed a double-blind, randomized controlled trial where BS was shown to result in 70% symptomatic improvement compared to 27% in the control arm. Gerhardt et al. [^@gerhardtTherapyActiveCrohn2001] showed BS to be non-inferior to mesalazine in Crohn's disease and Madisch et al. [^@madischBoswelliaSerrataExtract2007] showed an absolute 37% increase in the rate of clinical remission of Collagenous colitis. Kimmatkar et al.[^@kimmatkarEfficacyTolerabilityBoswellia2003] and Thawani et al. [^@thawaniOpenRandomizedControlled2007] both performed randomized controlled trials of BS in osteoarthritis and found improvements in pain, movement, swelling, and ability to accomplish activities of daily living. Most recently, there has been a surge of interest in BS in the setting of post-radiation edema following partial-brain and whole-brain radiation therapy. Retrospective reviews, case reports, and case series have documented a substantial reduction in cerebral edema with BS [^@RoleBoswelliaSerrata][^@warnickTreatmentAdverseRadiation2023][^@dipierroNovelLecithinbasedDelivery2019]. Kirste et al. [^@kirsteBoswelliaSerrataActs2011] performed a randomized controlled trial which demonstrated a >75% reduction in cerebral edema in 60% of patients receiving BS (compared to only 26% receiving placebo).

To our knowledge, there have been no reports documenting the use of BS in treating trismus. Herein, we provide a case report of BS augmenting passive range of motion interventions leading to the rapid resolution of the patient's trismus.

# Case Presentation

Our patient is a 54 year old previously-health male with no relevant past medical history. He had a 2 pack-year smoking history from 1990-2013 (~3-4 cigarettes per day) followed by weekly cigar use until 2020 at which point it became daily. He initially presented with discomfort and a sensation of fullness in the right posterlateral oropharynx with mild right-sided trismus. This prompted referral to an oral surgeon who ordered a contrast-enhanced CT of the neck which showed a 4.2 cm homogeneously-enhancing mass of the right palatine tonsil abutting the pterygoid musculature—there was no evidence of any regional nodal disease. He was referred to an otolaryngologist who performed a biopsy revealing p16-positive squamous cell carcinoma. A staging PET/CT was then performed, revealing FDG-avidity of the biopsy-proven right tonsillar mass which extended inferiorly, effacing the right vallecula. There was no evidence of FDG-avid regional or distant disease.

For this, the patient underwent definitive chemoradiation therapy with 70 Gy(RBE) delivered to gross disease, 63 Gy(RBE) to high-risk surrounding tissue, and 56 Gy(RBE) to the bilateral elective neck (levels II-IV) all in 35 fractions via a simultaneous integrated boost. Protons were used to minimize toxicity in the setting of bilateral elective neck treatment. Weekly cisplatin was administered concurrently. Treatment was completed in 50 days without any unanticipated complications or significant delays. A single replan was required due to tumor response and weight loss noted on cone beam CT. The patient experienced expected mild-moderate fatigue, mucositis, odynophagia, and dermatitis during his course of treatment.

At the time of the patient's 3-month post-treatment follow up, much of the acute, treatment-related side effects had resolved with only mild dysgeusia and mild trismus measured at 22 mm. Over the course of the next 3 weeks, the patient's trismus dramatically worsened, nadiring at 4-6 mm. *** At this point, the
