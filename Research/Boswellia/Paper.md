## Introduction
### Trismus Definition and Impact
Trismus is a pathologic restriction in jaw opening, defined as less than or equal to 35 mm [^@dijkstraCriteriaTrismusHead2006]. It commonly results in patients with head and neck cancer due to direct involvement of the masticatory muscles or due to fibrosis following surgery and/or radiation. It is a common problem in this population: approximately 50% of patients with oropharyngeal malignancies who underwent definitive treatment involving radiation therapy met the Djikstra definition for trismus[^@weberLimitedMouthOpening2010][^@louisekentRadiationInducedTrismusHead2008]; oropharyngeal disease is particularly prone with nearly 2/3rds meeting the definition [^@weberLimitedMouthOpening2010]. Not only is trismus common, it also substantially degrades quality of life with significant reductions in difficulty with mouth opening, chewing, decreased food intake, and overall quality of life [^@louisekentRadiationInducedTrismusHead2008][^@scottFactorsAssociatedRestricted2008].

### Existing therapies and effectiveness
There are a number of management options for patients experiencing trismus as described in the Cochrane systematic review by Carvalho et al.[^@carvalhoInterventionsPreventingTreating2016] Physical therapy plays an integral role in the management of trismus including both passive and active range of motion exercises as well as electrotherapy. Passive range of motion exercise are often implemented with the aid of devices to provide a controlled opening force to the jaw, both ad-hoc—as in stacked tongue depressors or wooden spatulas[^@shulmanTreatingTrismusDynamic2008][^@leeRandomisedFeasibilityStudy2018]— and commercially produced, such as the Therabite® and Dynasplint® systems. A number of analyses have been performed on Dynasplint® which have shown overall effect sizes on trismus ranging from 7 mm  [^@stubblefieldPreliminaryReportEfficacy2010] to 13.6 mm [^@shulmanTreatingTrismusDynamic2008] of improvement and a rate of change estimate of 0.36 mm per day[^@barananoDynasplintManagementTrismus2011]. For Therabite®, Sherpenhuizen et al. [^@scherpenhuizenEffectExerciseTherapy2015] performed a systematic review identifying 4 studies assessing the impact of this device on radiotherapy-induced trismus. Kamstra et al. [^@kamstraTheraBiteExercisesTreat2013] identified a 5.4 mm mean increase and Tang et al. [^@tangRandomizedProspectiveStudy2011] showed a net mean benefit of 5 mm. Of particular interest are Buchbinder et al. [^@buchbinderMobilizationRegimensPrevention1993] and Pauli et al. [^@pauliExerciseInterventionTreatment2014] which also report the duration of Therabite® treatment, allowing for a calculation of rate of change:  0.19 mm/day and 0.09 mm/day, respectively. 


Some systemic therapies have shown some promise in augmenting progress with , notably pentoxifylline
