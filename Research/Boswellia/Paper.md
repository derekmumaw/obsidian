## Introduction
### Trismus Definition and Impact
Trismus is a pathologic restriction in jaw opening, defined as less than or equal to 35 mm [^@dijkstraCriteriaTrismusHead2006]. It commonly results in patients with head and neck cancer due to direct involvement of the masticatory muscles or due to fibrosis following surgery and/or radiation. It is a common problem in this population: approximately 50% of patients with oropharyngeal malignancies who underwent definitive treatment involving radiation therapy met the Djikstra definition for trismus[^@weberLimitedMouthOpening2010][^@louisekentRadiationInducedTrismusHead2008]; oropharyngeal disease is particularly prone with nearly 2/3rds meeting the definition [^@weberLimitedMouthOpening2010]. Not only common, trismus also substantially degrades quality of life with significant reductions in difficulty with mouth opening and eating [^@louisekentRadiationInducedTrismusHead2008].
