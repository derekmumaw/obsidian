## Background and Aims
Spot-scanning Proton Arc Therapy (SPArc) is a new delivery technique which promises faster treatment times over existing step-and-shoot Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy (IMPT) techniques. There has been an increase in demand for proton therapy resulting in many new centers being built and existing centers being retrofit with additional vaults. To explore the added value of additional vaults in light of the increased throughput offered by SPArc, we constructed a model.

## Methods
A model was developed incorporating SPArc and IMPT machine delays obtained from de Jong et al. (PMID: 36373893), patient couch setup  and egress time  (13.3 min.), irradiation time (IMPT: 2.4 min./field, SPArc: 4 min./arc), and beamline switching time (30 sec.). To more accurately model real world use-cases, patients could have an anesthesia delay (20 min.) incorporated. The model's throughput and duty-cycle predictions were validated with two institutions' clinical logfiles. The model was then applied to simulate a 15-hour clinical operation day to quantify the effects of vault number and anesthesia requirements on throughput and per-patient on-couch waiting time.

## Results
Validation was successful. With a single vault for 11 hours, the model predicted 22.9 treatments compared to 21 reflected in the clinical logfiles (20% anesthesia). With a 2-vault setup for 8.3 hours, the model predicted 33.4 treatments compared to 35 logged treatments (5% anesthesia). In the latter scenario, duty cycle logs were available: the model prediction (23%) and logfiles (26%) agreed.

On simulation of a 20% anesthesia cohort, median maximum daily patient throughput increased logarithmically with increasing vault number (#) for both SPArc (throughput = 33 + 96 x log(#): r^2=0.96) and IMPT (throughput = 32 + 63 x log(#): r^2=0.99). SPArc was able to treat 24, 25, 29, 37, and 49% more patients than IMPT in 1–5 vaults, respectively (p<0.001 for all). Comparing 20% to 0% anesthesia requirements, with SPArc, anesthesia incurred a relatively constant 18±1% loss in throughput irrespective of vault number while IMPT's loss improved linearly from 17–6% from 1–5 vaults.

Median on-couch waiting times (minutes) increased quadratically with increasing vault number (#) for both SPArc (wait = -0.54# + 0.29#^2 + 0.86: r^2=0.99) and IMPT (wait = 1.25# + 0.63#^2 + 0.01: r^2=1.0). Compared to IMPT, SPArc reduced on-couch wait times by 77±4%— consistent across vault counts (p<0.001 for all). Anesthesia incurred increases in on-couch time which worsened linearly with increasing vault count from 1–5 for both SPArc (0–30%) and IMPT (1–15%).

## Conclusion
This model suggests that the reductions in SPArc treatment time can improve the treatment workflow efficiency across all proton center configurations as measured by improved patient throughput and reduced on-couch waiting time relative to IMPT. The optimal number of vaults appears to be limited by anesthesia requirements and on-couch waiting time, but this warrants further analysis.
