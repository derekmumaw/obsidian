## Background and Aims 
Conventional intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) 

The goal is to determine the efficiency of using Spot-scanning Proton Arc therapy (SPArc), a promising new treatment modality, compared to the conventional Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy (IMPT) in single and multi-room proton therapy centers with varying patient populations (e.g., percentage of anesthesia patients and number of fields per patient). 

## Methods 
A new treatment workflow simulation utilizes three main factors: (1) Machine delays [ref 1]. (2) Patient setup time on the couch (10.3mins) and anesthesia procedure (20mins additional). (3) treatment irradiation time (average 2.4mins per IMPT field and 4mins per SPArc field). Other factors include room switching time (30s) and patient leave time (3mins). The simulator’s predicted patient throughput as well as accelerator usage is validated based on two institutions' clinical logfiles. After validation, the simulator is used to estimate the daily treatment throughput and patient waiting time on the treatment couch using SPArc and IMPT based on 80% non-anesthesia patients and 20% anesthesia patients, assuming a 15-hour clinical operation day. 

## Results 
The clinical logfiles and the simulator’s predictions agreed closely. The simulator predicts 33.44 treatments in 8.3 hours for a two-room system compared to 35 treatments (95% non-anesthesia patients and 5% with anesthesia) and 23% of the duty cycle of the accelerator compared to 26% recorded on the logfile on that day. For the single-room system, it predicted 22.9 treatments in 11 hours compared to 21 treatments on that day (80% non-anesthesia patients and 20% anesthesia patients). Regarding the maximum daily treatment throughput prediction, SPArc increased 25%, 33%, 47%, 62%, and 77% (Figure 1) for 1-5 room systems, respectively. The study also found that SPArc saved an average of 1.4min, 4.0mins, 7.6mins, 11.9mins and 16.5mins of patient waiting time on the treatment couch for 1-5 room systems, respectively. 

## Conclusion
SPArc can improve the treatment workflow efficiency across all the proton center configurations. More daily treatment throughput was observed in centers with more treatment rooms, reducing patient waiting time on the couch.
