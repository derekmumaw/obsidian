# Methods
## Patient Identification
A retrospective review of tumors treated at our institution was performed to identify 10 large tumors defined as having a maximum tumor diameter of greater than 6 cm. The electronic medical record was used to extract patient and tumor characteristics.

## Volume Generation
For all tumors, the low-dose target was generated by a 0.5 cm isotropic expansion of the physician-contoured gross tumor volume (GTV)—if available, the IGTV was used.

The high-dose target consists of a set of regularly-spaced vertices, the placement of which was accomplished via an algorithmic approach implemented in MIM 7.3.4 (MIM Software Inc., Cleveland, Ohio), ensuring standardization and consistency.  Vertices were 1.5 cm in diameter and arrayed within the low-dose target in a body-centered cubic lattice. The lattice structure was repeated with a 6 cm period in all dimensions. This resulted in a minimum 5.75 cm distance (3√2 cm + 1.5 cm) to include two vertices, edge-to-edge, thus accounting for our 6 cm tumor diameter selection criteria. Vertices were clipped if within 0.5 cm of the PTV border or 1.5 cm of a critical organ-at-risk (OAR) which resulted in partial (non-spherical) vertices. Prior to clipping, the lattice structure was manually translated with the primary goal of maximizing number of complete vertices and a secondary goal of maximizing total high-dose volume.  To facilitate plan optimization, an avoidance structure was generated by offsetting the lattice by 3 cm (in effect, inverting the lattice). The end result is depicted in Figure 1. with the teal background representing the low-dose volume, the green representing the high-dose volumes/vertices, and the purple representing the avoidance structure.

## Planning
In all cases and for all techniques, the low-dose volume was planned to 20 GyE in 5 fractions and the vertices were planned to 66.7 GyE via a simultaneous integrated boost. The planning goals for both low-dose and high-dose volumes were D\_95% > 95%.  These values are in accordance with those used by Duriseti et al {_citation_}. OAR constraints per AAPM TG-101 {_citation_} were prioritized over target coverage. RayStation {_version number_} ({_company_})  was used for planning.

As a benchmark, volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans were generated with a clockwise and counter-clockwise arc for use on a {_linac model_} with {_MLC number/width_} at 6 MV {_confirm_}. Proton plans were generated for an IBA Proteus ONE which utilizes spot-scanning. Intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) plans were generated with 3 or  4 fields. SPArc plans were generated using a single {_partial?_} arc. {_anything else felt necessary/important from a Physics perspective_}

## Statistics
Dose-volume histograms (DVH) were collected from the treatment planning system. Maximum, minimum, and mean doses; equivalent uniform dose (EUD); D95%, D50%, D10%, D5%; V19Gy;  gradient index (GI), and low-dose and high-dose Conformity Indices (CI) were extracted. Peak-to-valley dose ratios (PVDR) were calculated as the ratio of the mean dose of the voxels at high dose (D\_0–1) and low dose (D\_70-90)—a modification of the method presented by Zhang et al. {_citation_}; this method was chosen as it is not subject to user-error in selecting peak and valley locations, is robust to outliers, and incorporates more voxels than line dose profile methods.

The dose gradients—as quantified by PVDR, GI, and low-dose and high-dose CI—achieved by each of the three techniques were compared via a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A mean DVH and 95% confidence interval were calculated for each technique. Difference plots were generated for each comparison with significance of difference calculated by Wilcoxon signed-rank test. For all analyses, α was set at 0.05. All statistical analyses were completed using Python 3.9.7 via Anaconda 3 (Anaconda, Inc., Austin, Texas). A Python Jupyter notebook for all analyses is available upon request.

# Results
## Descriptive Statistics
In total, 10 patients were identified with the following site breakdown: 4 lung, 3 pelvis, 2 abdominal, 1 head and neck. Median age was 71 years old (range: 58–81) and sex was split evenly male-female. Median tumor GTV was 519 cc (147–1920 cc). A median of 4 high-dose vertices (range: 2–15) were treated of which 2 (1–9) were complete vertices and 1.5 (0–6) were partial. The median percentage of GTV occupied by lattice vertices was 1.1% (0.7–1.7%). Median deliver time was XX (range) for SPArc, XX (range) for IMPT, and XX (range) for VMAT. Figure 1 shows a representative tumor with plans from each technique as well as a line-dose comparison in the plane of the vertices (to better demonstrate peak magnitude) as well as out-of-plane to demonstrate homogeneity in the low-dose region.

## Dosimetric Analysis

Dosimetric characteristics are reported in Table 1.

In all plans, OAR constraints were met.

Low dose coverage was maintained in all plans with a median V_19Gy (V_95% of low-dose prescription) of 96%, 95%, and 93% in the SPArc, IMPT, and VMAT plans, respectively.

SPArc generated significantly greater dose gradients. The median peak-valley dose ratio was 7.5% greater than IMPT (4.3 vs. 4.0, p=0.002) and 10.3% greater than VMAT (4.3 vs. 3.9, p=0.049). SPArc also had a lower median high-dose gradient index, 28% lower than IMPT (6.9 vs. 9.6, p=0.002) and 44% lower than VMAT (6.9 vs. 12.3, p=0.006). SPArc generated a significantly greater median low-dose conformity index than VMAT (0.855 vs. 0.615, p=0.012) but a slightly lower median high-dose conformity index than IMPT (0.56 vs. 0.57, p=0.014).

Figure 2 presents all individual DVH curves, the calculated mean curve, and the 95% confidence interval. Dosewise comparisons shown in the smaller, intervening graphs demonstrate the relative advantage of SPArc at every dose-level with significant differences indicated in red. Compared to IMPT, SPArc was able to achieve significantly greater volumes at high-dose levels from 66–102.5 GyE—in this range, there was a mean of 16% and up to a maximum of 26% greater coverage. It was also able to significantly increase homogeneity at low-dose levels from 20.5–36 GyE—in this range, there was a mean of 8% and a maximum of 24% volume reduction. These advantages were even greater when compared to VMAT. Significantly greater volumes were achieved at high-dose levels from 71–86.5 GyE—in this range, there was a mean of 22% and up to a maximum of 26% greater coverage. Again, there was also significantly improved homogeneity at low-dose level from 17–42 GyE—in this range, there was a mean of 12% and a maximum of 42% volume reduction.
