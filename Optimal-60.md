```
- RT for PET6+ bulky ≥ 7.5 cm (n=80) to 39.6 Gy (78% actually received RT, n=62). 
- No RT for PET6bulky ≥ 7.5 cm.
- PET6(+) in 48% of bulky, 78% of these received RT. Compared to ~60% RT on RICOVER-60.

# results
- 4y PFS for PET6(+) no RT / PET6(+) RT / PET6(-) no RT of 35→ 70→ 80%.
- 2y PFS for bulky OPTIMAL > 60 / RICOVER-60 of 79→ 75%.
- 2y OS for bulky OPTIMAL > 60 / RICOVER-60 of 88→ 78%.

>[!summary] 
> There is a clear trend to 5% decreased PFS with the omission of RT to bulky disease which is PET(-) after chemo, and potential OS detriment. This difference was deemed non-inferior, indicating RT can be spared in PET(-) bulky disease, resulting in a 40% relative reduction in RT use as compared to RICOVER-60, which irradiated all initially bulky disease.
Small number of patients.
