# Coding/RVU
## CPT Codes
- AMA
- all billing is based on CPT codes
	- CMS.gov has a calculator for all of this, if you are curious

### Medicare Sets "benchmark price"
- insurance companies set their own price (negotiation) based on a multiplier of the CMS price
- another layer of complexity. May be different group-to-group in the same locality for the same service

### Every CPT Gets Assigned an RVU
- wRVU (work)
- PE RVU (practice expense)
- Malpractice RVU

### Geographic Price Conversion Index (GCI)
- separate conversion factor for each of the three RVU types
- changes every year (set by CMS)

### $ X RVU Rate
- some employers have a dollar per RVU rate

### Future
- in general the GCI has been declining steadily snice 1999
- trying to get Radiation Oncology on alternative payment structures so we are less dependent on GCI
	- ROCR model (pushed by ASTRO and AMA)
		- Some good, some bad.
		- Probably inevitable given HypoFx and GIC problems
		- Reimbursement pegged to inflation (not true at the moment)

### Staying up to Date
- ASTRO and ACRO publish guidelines

# Charges Vs Revenue; Contracts
- Freestanding facilities usually get lower rates than hospital outpatient or hospitals (less negotiating power because private practice facilities are so much smaller)
	- a reason why private practice firms are getting gobbled up
- PPS exempt cancer hospitals (can charge whatever they want, not limited by medicare/medicaid)
	- City of hHope
	- USC kenneth
	- U of Miami
	- H. Lee Moffit
	- Dana-Farber
	- Memorial hospital
	- ROswell
	- Arthur G James
	- Fox Chase
	- MDA
	- Fred Hutch

# Billing Workflow
## Eval and Management Codes (99xxx)
- New patients
	- not seen by RadOnc in past 3 years, otherwise Established patient
- GG2212 for > 15 beyond max time
- GG2211 indicates more complexity or severity of condition

## Clinical Treatment Plan
- technically different from E&M and is a separate billable event
- Starts authorization process (i.e. why the billers are so concerned about this note)

## Selecting Codes
- ASTRO Coding Book (in our drive)
	- ShareDrive > RadOnc > Clinical > Scratch

### Planning
- Almost always 77263 (complex planning)

### Sim
- 77280 is treatment verify sim
- 77290 is complex sim (most of what we do)

### Dosi
- 77300 is basic dose calc (charged per beam/arc, up to 10)
- 77295 is 3D planning (conturing at least 2 structures)
- 77301 is IMRT (can't bill CT sim, can't bill separate physics, can't bill CBCT)
	- can and should bill the professional component of 77014-26
	- bill per field/arc?

### Treatment Delivery
- it's own set of codes
- Physicians don't get much here.

### OTVs
- at least 1 OTV/5 fx
- 77427
	- 90 Day exemption means no financial incentive for follow up visits withing this period (why RLD's notes are so brief)
