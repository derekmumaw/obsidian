Overall, see what their vision is

## Group Structure
- Employed or professional services agreement. Private that does their own billing? or are they employed and get a salary from the hospital
	- If employed: professional services only? or also facility fees?
	- if professional services agreement: is their a partnership track
		- how many years to partnership.
- Pressure to send patients to the mothership? (i.e. for protons, GK, MR-linac)

## ==Reimbursement==
- in a brand new facility, don't get involved in an eat-what-you-kill scenario at a totally new facility (no referral patterns). You'd need a base salary
	- Eat-what-you-kill
	- totally egalitarian (equal splits)
	- Some are $ driven, some are QOL driven
		- "How would you describe the culture of the group?"
			- academic?

## ==Referrals==
- how are they planning to generate referrals.
- are they bringing surgeons/MedOncs there? Or am I knocking on doors

## Ammeities
- clinical trials?
- Tumor boards?
- Peer Review
- Technology available at the site?
- Other RadOncs in the practice?
	- ==Coverage?== Do I have to find it? Locums coverage
- Vacation time
- How many sites would I have to cover in a given day.
- site specialization?

## Competition
- current competition in the area
	- dead zone with no care?
	- trying to outcompete other competitors?

## Misc
- direct supervision required?
	- Is this freestanding or hospital outpatient?
	- Do I have to be in the hospital physically or is just phone/video availability sufficient
	- No longer true in Michigan.
	- Be careful about how you ask this question (touchy subject)
		- "I assume the hospital follows direct supervision for everything"
- SLP? Social workers? PT? Dieticians.
	- usually not at a "new" center at first
- What happens if things fall through? The satellite closes, am I left out to dry?
- How busy? consults/week?
- ? when do they send out for protons, peds?

## Emphasize
- wide variety of patients (troy-dbn)
- GK, linac-SRS, proton, MR-linac
	- know when these are needed, when they are not
- high-volume
	- used to being busy
- Emphasize that I want stay and build a life/family
- Emphasize family connection
