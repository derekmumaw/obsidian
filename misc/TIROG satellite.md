# Practice Details
## Location
Jefferson health
critical resource hospital 
- more flexible with funding
- not very busy at first
	- because of critical resource designation
	- Jefferson hospital will supplement income to TIROG → 75% MGMA salaray + benefits (including vacation coverage (locums?)). 
- 50 mile sphere of influence
	- polsbo and sequim are the closest places
- part of the group (sorta)
	- peer review access
- Live on bainbridge, commute to Jefferson
- Flexibility in the future to move 
- Start in Seattle, move out there when it's ready (6 months)
- "bump and divide" 
	- everyone becomes a partner (over a few years). Mostly a professional group.
	- 100% physician owned. 
	- Base comp is 650k (with incentives on top of that)
	- 5y contract 
	- > intro to Jefferson folks (look at Port townsend on the map And Bainbridge)
	- > if that all is intriguing → then we "keep the conversation going"
